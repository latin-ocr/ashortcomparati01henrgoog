ἕ 2.-Hcllenio Formations.

(146) I. Sufflur ·1‹-.-All secundary perfecte have this sign,
before which the final vowel of the primavy stem undergoes
the same lengthening as before the -σ- of the aorist and future,
πε·φι’λ-η·κ-α, “wippa-u, ete. The perfect middle simply adds
the person-endings to the stem, which eventually became
similarly lengthened, πε-φίλ·η-μαι, τε-τί-μη-μαι.

Π. Sufflrr -oo oi the future-perfect; this form is rather rare,
and presente no difficulty: πε-φιλ·ή-σο-μαι, τεέτῖ-μή-σο-μαι.

„ III. Suffia -εσ- of the pluperfeot: added directly to the
perfect stem, whatever this may be : ε’-λε-λύ-κ-ε-οι (Ι had hosed),
class, ἐ-λε-λύ-κ-η and ele-lexov}

IV. Suffioc -drr.-Derivative verbs no longer possess the
aorist passive in -η-; but'the aorist passive in -θη- has been
extended so far as to be the only form in classical Greek. The
long vowel of ἐφίλ-ψσα recurs in &dih-vider, ieri-pieac, eto.

V. Suffier daiam—Similarly it is the future passive in -θήσο-,
not that in -vjoa, which has been adopted by secondary verbs:
φιλ-ψθήσο-μω. It will be notioed that these two formatione
are liable sporadically to the analogica] insertion of the same
-σ· which hasbeen already mentioned and explained in the case
of the perfect‚2 ap. κελεύ-ω (to command), κε-κέλωσ-μω, ε’-κελώ
σ-θη-ν, κελευ-σ-θήσο-μαι.

§ 3.—Lutc'n Formationa

(147) Ι. Snfflrc -d-: forms the subjunctive present of all
verbs of the had, 3rd, and etth conjugatione without distinction:
merc-cunr, capium, celaia-m, par-toreca.

ΙΙ. Scffic -bei·: forms the imperfect of all verbs-In the
lst and 'end conjugation we have quite regularly uma-boen,
morra-een,- for in the first place we have seen that the
final vowel of arne, mone, may very well have been long in
certain positione ;³ and even supposing it was not long here,
it must necessarily have become so, at any rate in nocendam:
*arrone-ebora. But in the 3rd conjugation we should expect
