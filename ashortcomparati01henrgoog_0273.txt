With this exception, the declension is of the simplest
cheremon-sing: nom. ἱππεύς; voc. ἱππεῦ; aco. *ἶππῆΈ-α, Lesb.
ἷπππα, Hom. ἱππῆα, Dor. and New Ion. ἱππέα, Att. ἱππέᾶ; Ιοο.
ἱππῖγι, whence ῖππέῖ end ἱππεῖ; gen. Hom. imi-ipos, Now Ion.
ῖππέος, Att. runem-Plus: nom. ἱππῆ-ες, New Ion. ἱππέες, Att.

ἶππεῖς and ἶππῆς; acc. ἶππῆ-ας, Now Ion. ἱππέας, Ati. ἱππέᾶς by
metathesis, sometimes ἱππέᾶς with simple shortening‚ lastly
ἱππεῖς and ἱππῆς, horrowed from the nominative3 loc. tractem
Panhellenic; gen, ἱππή-ων, New Ion. and Att. ἱππέων.

ΠΙ. stema in ·ow- and -oy-.-Stems which have the sig·
matio nominative (cp. ἥρω-ς)1 have the long vowel in all cases:
ἥρω-αε*ἦρωὶ-α, ἥρω-ος, etc. The other stems2 have it only in
the nom. sing, πειθῴ πειθό-α. Declension: nom.A⁷1rqi=*Aordyor
Aprci=*Advmf; voc. Λητοῖ, aco. Ion. Λητοῦν (of. βοῦν), Dor. Λᾰτῶν
(of. βῶν), but commonly ΛητώῧεΛητόατἊᾶτόψα or Aciro'f-u3 the
other cases present no difficulty. The external resemblance
between these stems and those in -ον- led to meny confusions
between the two classes: thus Hodoi (Delphi) became Πῦθών,
whence the two parallel declensions Πῦθοῦς Hodoi end Πῦθῶνος
Πῦθῶνι ·; we find the nompl. Γοργόνες, from Γοργῴ, in Hesiod‚ and,
on the other hand, in Sophocles, the genitive ἀηδοῦς, from ἀηδών.4

(214) The stems in -i- and -a- follow two very different
modes of declension‚ which seem to correspond respectively
to an original longor short quantity in the termination. An

· · tor τι in the stem is not subject to any gradation; it is

simply split up into a vowel and semi-vowel (ty, acc) before
terminatione beginning witha vowel; then, on the loss of the
semi-vowel, there remains only a short vowel, ep. ἰχθῦ-ς, gen.
*ἰχθῠΈ-ος ἶχθῦος. On the other bandi and ri are subject to a
special kind of gradation; they take the normal forms ey and
ew respectively before terminatione beginning with a vowel,
end remain reduced before aconsonant. Greek maintains

¹ Supra 200, 2. ² Supra 131.

⁸ We should expect ’Ληπῶ, ’vectii etc„ but the secentuation has been
listurbed through the analogy ot the nominative.
