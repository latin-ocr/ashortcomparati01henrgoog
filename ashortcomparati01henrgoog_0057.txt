the middle part of it, leaving only the two sides free; the
current of air, being thus impeded, is obliged to split itself
up into two portione in order to find an outlet, and ¹vibratos
while forcing a passage for itself in the narrow space between
the oheeks and teeth. This is the lateral trill l.

These two trills, or liquids‚ may be either accompanied
ornet by a very slight'vibration of the vocal ohords. Iu the

first case, which is far the commonest, they are called voiced '

or sonorous3 the second case, that of surd or voioelese
liquids‚ is illustrated by Greek initial ῤ, and by an l occurring

v in the Slavonic languages. Ι

It is now time to ask whether the different sormds eorre-
sponding to positione 4, 5, and 6 are consonante or vowels. We
know they are usually called consonante, and they really
appear to be so in combinatione like admit, nostrii, outlet, where
they have avowel to support them. But let us compare, for
example, the word outlet with beata both are evidently dis·
syllables, and are felt by the speaker to be so. In the former
word the vowel of the second syllable is ashort e; what is it
in the latter? It is not a short e, for nobody pronounoes
the word as britel, the l is rather pronounoed with a short
and trilling lateral sound, which by itself fills the whole syl-
lable, viz. keil. In other words, in English katile, German
mittet, etc, the l acts the part of a vowel. The same is the
· ease with r; an exaotly corresponding trilling sound occurs,

for example, in German schwestcr and Erench arbre, which, Α

though evidently a dissyllable,is not pronounoed orbre'or arber,
but rather arbr; thetis, the r here becomes a vowel. This
ζ and ρ’ are called sonant liquids‚ and are both very common
in German final syllables. German and English also supply
many examples of vocalic or sonant nasals ; thus a sonantry
occurs in English bacea, German bosea, pronounoed respec-
tively, baert, hctfgma sonant ry in English fathore, seldene,
pronounoed fntbrp, serap, etc. To sum up, the nasals and
liquids are both consonants and vowels: consonante
when they are supported by a vowel ; vowels generally when-
ever they support another consonant, and particularly when
they occur between two consonante.
