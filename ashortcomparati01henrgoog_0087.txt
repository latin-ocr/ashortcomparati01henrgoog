cess must undoubtedly go back to the parentspeeeh. The
syllables in question may be alassified according as they eontain
in the normal form (1) an ὅ, whether alone or forming part
of a diphthong; (2) any other. short vowel, whether alone or
forming part of a diphthong ; (3) along vowel.

1. Narmal form ἔ. The gradation is hera so clear as to
leave nothing to be desired. In the deflected grado ἔ becomes
ὄ; in the weak grado it entirely disappears. In this ease,
if the eforms part of a diphthong, the semi-vowel of the
diphthong becomes avowel in order to support the syllable;
if the &stands by itself‚ the syllable disappears along with
it, provided that the consonante whieh it supported bave any
other vowels close by to support them3 but if the weakening
would result in an unpronouneeable group of consonante, the
ἑ is retained by this group and then the weak is not distin-
guished from the normal grado. We will now examine these
different positione:
