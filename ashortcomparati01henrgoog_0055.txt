being widened.

2. The action of the soft palate (veliam palati). In front,
that is, for two-thirds of their extent, the noso and mouth are

Ι completely isolated from one another by the bony arch of the

palate; but from the pharynx to the nasal cavities there isa
passage, which can however be closed by means of a fieshy and
movable prolongation of the palate, called very appropriately
the “veil of the palate.'' When, the mouth being at rest, the
veil falls like a loose curtain, the two cavities are in free
communication with one another ; but when it ¹rises and rests
on the back part of the pharynx, it isolates the nasal cavitieS,
and so rendere the whole upper half of the sounding-board

shape of a grapa, called the uvula, which has a share in the
productiones speech (infra 21).

3. The extreme mobility of the tongue, which by rest ing
successively against tthe soft palate, the back, middl‚e or front
partos the palatal arch, the gums, the teeth, eta, is capable of

producing an infinit te variety tof modificat trons in the shape of '
the mouth and its mode of opening.

. The sounding board reflecte, increaseS, and varies the
musical sounds omitted through the glottis; but, besides
these, the movements of the tongue and lips producenoiseS,
which may be either momentary and explosive, when the
mouth opens or shuts suddenly, or continuous and frica-
tive‚ when the mouth being almost closed only allows the
air to escape at any point through avery narrow passage.
The musical sounds are the vowels. The noises, whether
accompanied or not by voice produced in the glottis, are the
