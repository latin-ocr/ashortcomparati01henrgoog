European origin, it is extremely common in Greek and Latin,
in which it seems mainly to be the result of an irregular
transition of classes IV and V to the thematic conjugation:
Gk. cri-vor, AEol. πώ-νω (to drink), (tf. Lat. potu-8, δάκ-νω (to bite),
τέμ-νω (to cut), Lesb. βόλλομαι, Ion. Bodhopat=*ssdh-ro-)aot;
Old Lat. ducunt (they give),¹ ue-qut-ou-at (they cannot),
red-t-uu-ut (they return), eto, class. li-uo (to smear), si-ao
(to permit), of. supra li-tuou, st-tu-m. With this formation are
connected a certain number of othere, much more complicatsd,
and 'apparently modified by various analogioal influences.

1. In Greek we sometimes find a suffix veo, which, like ·vo-,
occurs only in the present: ῑκ-νέο-μαι (Ι come), of. aor. ῖκ-ό-μην;
κυ-νέω (to kiss), ci. aer. ἔ-κυ-σ-α.

2. Some verbs in -νω seem to arise from -rfe, that is, from
the snffix -νυ- added to the thematic conjugation, with regular
substitutiones w for u before a vowel: ap. &ve (to shake),
κλῑνω (to incline), κρῖνω (to distInguish, cf. Lat. cer-ao), corre-
sponding to AEolic δίννω, ativae, κρίννω, etc.; also φθᾶ-νω (to
anticipato), τῑ·νω (to expiate), φθῖ-νω (to destroy), where the
radioal r, always long iu the time of Homer, is shortened in
later versification. ·

3. When the root ends in a consonant, the meeting of this
consonant with the nasal of the suffix seems to have usually
developed a sound which was represented as an epenthetic
vowel :2 the suffix then took the form -avo, cp. ἁμαρτ-άνω (to
err, aor. ἥμαρτ-(νν). Moreover, in the oldest and commonest

' type, the nasal of the suffix was somehow reflected in the root,

by a phonetic process not yet satisfactorily explained, though
easily conceivable: thus a root λᾶθ (to be hidden) would give
*λᾰθ-νω, whence *hdvd-unr and *λάνθ-ζινω, and lastly hard-tvoss
So also with λαγχάνω (root λεγχ, cf. perf. λε’-λογχ-α), λαμβ-άνω,
λιμπ-άνω (to leave), πυνθάνομαι (to learn), and without nasaliza-
tion ληθ-άνω, κευθ-άνω (to hide), αὐξ-άνω (to increase), dupli-dvo

Mutavit Hercota· mactante mereto.’¹

² This phenomeon is exactly parallel to that ol the Dutoh kaif (kniie),
which has become in French coais= *kpaisss
