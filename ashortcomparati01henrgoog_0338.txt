:lli-aila) *ἔκαυμκν, ἔθηκα1 *ἕθεκμεη *amaa ἔκταμεν (di-arty-
μεν), eto. The last form was faithfully retained in the plural
and dual, and from the 3rd pl. ἔκταν was even formed an ana·
logical erd sing. ἔκτα (Hom). We shall also find in the middle
the equivalent of *ἔχομεα But, as a general rule, the entire
stem of the sing, including the ο of the lst person regarded as
a thematic vowel,2 was transferred without modification to the “
plural and dual, ἐχέαμεν and ἐχεύαμεν, ἐθήκαμεν, etc.

Latin has nothing that can be compared with these forms,
’ except that its present atat=*atdt resembles ἔστη (*στᾶ·τ wilh-
out augment) muoh more closely than any other Greek form.

2. The sigmatio aorist is a non-thematio aorist ending ina

consonant3 hence its regular inflexion would be ἔ-λειψ-α, *ἔλοψ η

' =*d'-ltttdt·3‚ *ἕλειψε*ἔλειψ·τ, *hlud-patu, *ἔλοψ-τε, *ἔ-λιψ-αν.
But we know what took place: the α of the lst sing. and 3rd
Ι pl. was added to the stem;‘³ while, in regard to the root, the
weahened form *ἔλιψον was retained and even extended to
the sing, especially in verbs which already had the weakened
root in the present, ἔσχισα, ἔοτιξο, cf. σχίζοεὴχίαηο, στίζω,
eto. 34 in all other cases it was the grade of ἔλειψο, sometimes
modified (ἔλῦσο ior *ἔλεοσαλ which prevailed, and in any case
there is no longer a traco of gradation in the transition from
the singular to the plural and dual.

l fortiori this uniformity is absolute in the Latin inflexion,
dica· dicimus, which is that of the perfect.

3. Non-thematic aoristf ἔλαβον, ἔλιπον, ἔφυγον, etc.; in Latin,
barely a few traces of this formation.⁵

(285) H. Μαῖα-1. A. The regular weak form in ἐθέμην,
ἐδάμην, eto. ; the long vowel of metathesis in Hom. πλῆτο (it
filled itself); the strong form (very rare) extended in Att.
ὧνήμην for ὠνάμην, from ὀνίνημι (to benefit).

B. Ταθ regular weak form in ἔχυτο, Hom. χύτο (it was poured),
ἔσσυτο, Hom. σι’πο (it was thrown‚ lst sing. aot. ἔσσευα), ἀπέκτατο
(αθ was killed); the strong form and the false stomin α ex-
tended in ἐκήοπο, eto.
