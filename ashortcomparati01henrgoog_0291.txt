the analogy of ὑμές), ἡμές (long α), Boeot. οὐμές, ete. The Homeric,
Ionio, and Attio forms ἡμεῖς, ὑμεῖς (long υ) are due to the analogy
of the nom. pl. of the stems in -εσ-,1 and the stem σφέ, which
is much later than the others, nowhere appears except with
this long termination‚ σφεῖς.

2. noceantne-Tha oldest forms are ἄμμε, ὔμμε, cpi? found
in Homer (Dor. ἁμέ, ὑμέ, σφέ, and Lesb. ἅσφε.). Βαῖμιε early
astho Homeric period, there were formed on the model ol
ἡμεῖς, etc, the new accusatives ἡμέας, ὑμέας, σφεάς;3 the same
forms appear in New Ionic; Att. ἡμῖις, ἡμᾶς, σφεῖς, and in poetry
ἡμᾶς, ἡμᾶς, σφᾶς (ΙΙ. ν. 567).4 The last word even has a nom.-
acc. nent. σφέα in Herodotus and the Attio poeta.

3. Locative (detinet—Originally probably *ἀμμῐν *ὐμμῐν (like
ε’μῐν τῐν in the sing.): Hom. and Lesb. ἄμμι (Il. ix. 427) ἅμμῖν,
ίμμι (Il. vi. 77) ὕμμῖν, σφῖν ἀσφι; Dor. ἆμῐν ἁμίν, ὑμῖν (Boeot. οῧμῖν)
ὑμίν, σφῖν; Ait. ἡμῖν ἦμῖν, ὑμῖν ὗμῖν, σφίσιν. The last form,
which is found also in Homer, is evidently due to the analogy
of τισίν and other nominal locatives‚ as is also the case with
Lesbian ἄμμεσιν.

4. &colliva-The termination being the sameas in the sing„
the genitive must have been *ἀμμεῖο *ὒμμεῖα cf. ε’μεῖα. These
endings were pluralised to *ἅμμείων *appelata and thence: Lesb.
ἀμμέων, ὐμμέων, σφέων, Dor. ἁμέων ἁμῶν, ὗμέων σφέων; Hom. Ion.
ἡμείων ἡμέων, ὑμείων ὑμέων, σφείων, σφέων 3⁵ Att. ἡμῶν, ὑμῶν, σφῶν.

B. Latia-1. Nom-Aca: nos, voa, cf. Gk. dual νώ.

2. Dae-Aet: nobas vobis. If we may trust the evidence
of Sanslrrit, it is possible that there existed in Latin a dat-abl.
*nobilia and an instrum. *aaaron It was the latter form
probably which survived with both functione, but with its
termination lengthened on the analogy of the dat-abl. of the
and nominal declension.

¹ Thus ἡμεῖςι ἡμέων (gen.) εεύγενεῖςε εὐγενέων.

² As in the sing. ἐμέ, τέ, ἔ, Sk. abl. caract.

³ Thus ἡμέας : ἡμεῖςεεῦγενέας : εὐγενεῖς. In these lorms the gronp ea
almost invariably forms only one syllable.
⁴ According to the grammaticus, the perispomena are orthotona lorms in
hhidh the accent is thrown back are molitio, and so also in the case of
to ative.
⁵ Here syniaesis is naturally the invariable rulo.
