made itself felt, but it was restricted to the participles end
adjectives in nt· and c-: thus the regular *ferent-a, *prendunt-c,
etc, became ferent-io, prudent-io, audac-ia, selectaoictrtc-ia,
etc. ditent—a was still used in an old tragedy.l

3. Accusatioe masculine and feminine-The sign *ns after a
vowel, *ps after a consonant, pervades the whole declension: Gk.
πόλῐς (Herod.)=*v‹iht·vs, ixdbs=*i)(dtiv·s, σῦς, δρῦς, etc, πόδ-ἄςτ
*add-225 (cf. adl-t = *πόδήῃῂ ποιμέν-ἄς, φέροντ-ἅς,πατέρ-ἄς, etc.‚Lat.
ovis (also written aneis and aves) :Mei-ns, mancis=*mnnuns,
pedes=*ped·ens=*ped-ps (cf. quotiens and quoties), bomin-es,
ferent-es, potr-es, etc. The partial likeness between the nom.
noes and acc. note, which the fluctuating spelling tended to
increase, and thet between the aco. ouis oves and the accserentes
ferentis, caused them to become entirely confused, so that in
the 3rd decl. the nom. and acc. became identical. In Greek,
ἰχθύ-ας (Hom), πόλι-ἅς (Hom.) and πόλε·ἅς are due to the intru-
sicn of the termination -ἄς horrowed from the consonantal stems.
The semeis the case with πελέκεας, ἡδέας (we should expect
*πελέκῦς, *vibis cf. acc. sing. πέλεκυ-ν, ἡδύ-ν), which are formed
on the analogy of the genitivos πελέκε-ος, ἡδέος, etc. The Attio “
forms πόλεις, πελέκεις, ἡδεῖςε*ἡδε’Ὲ-ες, εὖγενεῖςε*εΰγενε’σ·ες, are
nominatives used as accusatives, just as we have seen above that
manus isan accusative used as nominative. Similarly the stems
in -ηύ- have ἶππέᾶςτ*ἶπτηῆἄςε*ἶππῆῈ-ἄς and iuncis: ἱππέες. The
form ὅρνῐς or ὄρνεις (OEd. R. 966) for ὅρνῐθας is due to the analogy
of πόλῐς 01¹ πόλεις (cf. supra 204, 4).

4. resonarent-A few examples in Homer: νόσ-φι (behind,
cf. Lat. noti-bus), ὅρεσ-φι, στήθεσ-φι; with insertion of the -o-
of the sud decl, κοτυληδον-ό-φιν (Od. v. 433). In Latin it was
confused with the dative-ablativo.

5. Destino-Ablatice-Instrumental(Latin).—Indo·Europeanhad
a termination *dbis (sk. dbis) for the instr. pl. and *bbios (sk.
-bhyasl for the dat—abl. pl. The former would have become
in Latin ton, the latter teies, bitte. These two terminatione

the final vowel ἄ from being regularly changed to ἕ, ct. suipra 35 Aa. end
my Esq. nicephol. IV. (Douei 1887).

prudentia ε prodentibuseatcric ι eertum).
