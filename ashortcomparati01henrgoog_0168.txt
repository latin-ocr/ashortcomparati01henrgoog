To this class apparently must he referred the Hellenie forma-
tion in -ανο-, in which the a must have developed a vowel sound
before itself; ey. dpyavcv (instrument), adr-avoc (cake, root
πεπ, to cook), dpe‘rr-cvcw (scythe), pricharto-1 (crown), cip-crde
(heaven, of. εὕρ-10, wide), μηχ-ανή (device), etc, and, with
nasalization of the root,¹ τύμπονον (drum, cf. τύπ-τω).

(117) XIV. Stems with suffic -to·.-These include two
formatione of very unequal importanoe. The first comprises
only a few stems with deflected root: Gk. noim) (bed, cf. κεῖ-μαι),
βροντή (thunder, 01. βρέμ-ω, Lat. fremo), >picto-r and Lat.
hor-taes. The other includes the large class of stems called
in Greek verbals in -τό- and in Latin past participles passive:
θε-τό-ς, hard-s, στα-τό-ς, κλυ-τό-ς, λυ-τό-ς, σχισ-τό-ς (deplet,
split); Lat. dc-tu-a, stet-tus, (fixed), ic-cltctu-a, 01110-111-1,
quassas (=*quat-ta-s, 0101001010, eto. Sanskrit and other
analogies show that in IndoEuropean this suffix -tc took the
aocent and consequently reduced the root. In Greek the
primitive accentuation was respeoted, that is, whenever the
stem retained its function as a verbal adjective ,a but the root,
which was reduced in all the above examples, was often
influenoed by the analogy 01 the tenses of the verb, especially
the present‘and sigmatic aorist, so that it shows the normal
¹grado in hermi-r (left), ῥηκ-τό-ς (fragile), dromi-e (to be avoided,
of. Hom. dated-c), and many other cases. In Latin the same Α
phenomenon took place: by the side of 01110-111-1, which is
attested by Fr. estroit and Ital. stretto, we find 110-111-0, on the
. analogy of 110111, froc-tues on that of 'frop-meatum, and so
also scriptas, 0111101108, juce-teas, *fad-tras (filaus), aecta-s,
on the analogy of scripsi, 8111101, junxi, fadi, 11001, etc,
lec-teas on the analogy of 1191, and 1101110 on that of lec-ta-s.
Sometimes the suffix is added to a dissyllabic form, the origin
of which is not clear, eg. peni-ttae, cf. Gk. pire-ric!

(118) XV. Stema with sufflo ·ti·.—In common Greek the
suffix is usually assibilated to -σι-.5 All these stems are

¹ 0110110913. ¹ 0110110 641.

³compare napea-2 (sovcd) and hudo-ra (proper camd-oram) γῆ
(cultivated land), and also the participle rear-rte (sent) with the ordinary
'‘i‘'olspitillthi. ‘cr apra to, 1.
