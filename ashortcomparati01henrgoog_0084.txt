The Ionio dialects lost it very early, and always replaced it by
the smooth breathing. Eg. ἔργ·ο-ν (work)=fc'py-o·v, cf. Ger.
werlo [English werith ἔπ·ος (word), εἶπέ (say)=ie'⁷r·oe, Ἑειπ-έ, cf.
Lat. voc-83 ido-ro ἅσ-τυ (11111111.811.οάε-11ι(11οι111); loix-os
οἰκ-11 (house)=Lat. oreos=Sk neq-ds, ete. Sometimes in
Greek the rough breathing seems to correspond to Latin v:
ἔννυμι, (Ion.) εἴνῦμι (I elothe)=*fe'o-vir-pr‚ cf. ves-ii-33 ἕσπερος
(west), Lat. vesper; ἑστίᾶ (hearth), Lat. Vestem but it is pro-
babis that in thie case the aspirata was developed in Greek
separately, end has nothing in common with the primitive w.
Initia] w before a consonant disappears in Latin: radia·
(root)=*wradtc-s, cf. Gk. 1ρίζα,(111. waraei. In some Greek
dialecto it remeius, in others it disappears: Elean iporpo=10m
ῥήτρη (agreement); ῥέζω (1ο do), Hom. fpilo=*fpe‘y-yo, cf.
Ὲέργ-ο-ν, 111. But even in those dialects which kept it we
. may suppose thet in the syntectioal combinationes words it was
assimilated to the following consonent; for example, that when·
Homer writes πολλὰ λισσομένω (λὰ being long by position), we
may read either πολλὰ Ἑλισσομένω or πολλὰ λλισσομένω.1 Such
reduplication is regular when the initiali becomes modial in
composition: 1Έρήν (sheep), gen. iope-63, Hom. πολύ-ρρην (rich in
sheep); ρήγ-νῦ·μ1 (to break), aor. pase. ε’-ρράγ-η, adj. ἅ-ρρηκ-τος
(unbreakable), etc. In this case however AEolic contracte·
the f with the preceding vowel, αὕρηκτοςε11-1ρηκτος, εὐράγη,
111.; and to a diphthong of the same kind must be referred the
Homerio form εὔαδε (11 pleased)=l'·fabe (1.9. Il. xiv. 340).
B.-Intervoealic. Apart from this last exceptione] sese,

intervocalic f was probably no longer pronounced in the lan·
guage of Homer, mnch less in later Ionio, Attio, and the
κοινή. But itis often found in Dorio inscriptions, Horeridfom,
wpofewrdrm, t’trtfoixots‚ and 11 was always kept in Latin: νέος
novos, ἐννέα 'nocem οἷς onie, etc. In tune=tooos (snpra 32
· A a), the v is not lost, bnt has coalesoed with the nnaccented 0‘2
as in denuo=*de novo: cf. anceps=aoi-ceps, otc.

[Homeris impl. ἐλλίσσετο (he 1111111111), but also sometimes ἑλίσσετο
(Iti, liliilppesessivee, like the pronouns from which they 111 derived. are
