Latin the group oo remeius efter e short vowel, odorus (vain)
from oddo, pressus from praelior, missus from mitte, but is
reduced efter o long vowel, mist=²¹⁸mtsst (ol. redeo uidi), sibus
:versos plotio from ploos, taem from laedo, eto.

(70) Final s remeius in Greek ond Latin, ἵππος equos, γένος
penus. But in Latin, et any rete in oertein positione, finelo

can only have been pronounoed very slightly3 it is oiten neg-
leoted in inscriptions, and until the Augustan ege it constitutes
position or not et the option of the writer: uersibus quos Olim
. . . (Eun.) . . . decidere falcibus ramos (Luor.). But it never
entirely disappeered3 for it is reproduoed with remarkable
fidelity in the Romanos lengueges.1

Is it to this possible loss of final s, or to a phenomenon of
Indo-European synteotioal phonetios, thet we must attribute
the Latin substitutiones the group er for the groups ris ros

. when preceded by a consonent,l in forms like dcer=doris end

oper=*op-ro-s, of. Gk. ἀγρός, Sk. etjros? However this may
be, the peculiarity is worth notioing3 but it is hard to reduoe
it to e lew, sinoe the genitivos potrus end patris, for example,
kept their termination unohenged.
