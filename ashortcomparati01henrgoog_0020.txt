outset to gain a good general view than to understand every
detail. But the second time it will be well for him to read
with pen in haud, marking occasionally the esseutial points,
and carefully verifying the numerous crass-references soattered
throughout the work. Another mothod 61 working, no less
profitable, but reserved for more advanced students, will be to
read through the alphabetical indices, and, whenever any form
at all unfamiliar strikes the eye, to seek the explanation of it
in the body of the book. Lastly, it will be found useful to pre·
pare any portion whatever of a Greek or Latin author, referring
to the grammar for each of the etymological or grammatical
forms there met with. This exercise has boen regularly
practised at my lecturas, and has always yielded the best
results.

‚If the printing 61 such a work as the present did not involve
quite enough difficulties in itself,I should have liked to dis-
tinguish by two different kinds 61 type the fundamental facts,
the retention 61 which is indispensable, from the host 61
secandary details for which an attentive reading will suffice.
In this matter I am forced to rely upon the discretiones the
student, who will find therein scope for exercising and forming
his judgment. Ι rely with more confidence on the tact and
judgment of the teaohers in our schools and collegas, for the

But if, in the course 61 611 explanation, or during the correction

the advantage of satisfying the young mind, always eager 161
61661 and logical explanations-and who can tolli—perchance
even of awakening, unknown to himself, some latent talant.
The important point is, not to initiate the pupil into this or that
detail, which will be forgotten assoon as learned, but to raise
discreetly the veil 61 the sanctuary, and give him a brief
glimpse 61 the beauty 61 this science, which is still too much
ignored, and which, to borrow the words 61 6116 61 its most
