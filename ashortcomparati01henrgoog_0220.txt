MORPHOLOGY.

(182) Morphology is the study of the forms of lan-
guage, that is, of the modifications by means of terminations
which nominal and verbal stems undergo in order to become
nouns and verbs capable of forming part of a sentence.

If taken in a very wide sense, morphology might likewise
include etymology, which has just been studiod3 and it would

even seem at first sight that the formation of a tense like
hey-diruo ought to be included under the head of conjugation
justas much as the addition to this stem of the termination
-μαι, tl-ccu, -ται, etc. But it has been thought better to restrict
the name of morphology to the study of terminations, in order
to make as clear as possible thelina of demarcation between
the formation of stoms and the inflexion of words, and to
insist'on the elementary truth‚ too often ignored‚ that, for ex-
ample, λέγ-ο- and λεχ-θήσο, on the one hand, are forms quite as
distinct and quite as independent of one another as are λόγ-ο-
and *λέγ-τι- (λέξις) ou the other. Hence morphology is reduced
for our present purpose to declension and that part of conjuga-
tion only which is concerned with the person-endings.

The terminations, both those of declension or case·
endings, and those of conjugation or person-endings,
appear iu language as the necessary complement of the nominal
or verbal stoms to which they are attached. It is only very
rarely‚ as we have seen, that the simple root without any affix

can'be used as a stem3 but it ilastffl rerer xfor the bare stem
