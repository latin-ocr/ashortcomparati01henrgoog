in the original tt-declension3 neither Sanshrit nor Greek

shows any traee of it, and the Latin ablative, terru=terrotd‚

praeduci (Ool. Rostr.)‚1 noctu Troiad exibunt capitibus opertis

(Saturnian verse of Naevius), used also as a locative (iu terret

like ia honestantur· or bortod in 2nd declension), may have

been formed by analogy from the ablative of the o-stems.
5. Ablotivc (2): no trace in this class of stems.
6. Ablutive (3): recognisable in a few Greek forms like

’ Ἀθήνη-θεν, πρώρᾱ-θεν (d premi), etc.

7. Instrumental (lp—We have seen that the adverbs in -o'i
are instrumentals of the masculine-neuter gandera But it is
quite possible that they include some feminine instrumentals3
as the vowel resulting from contractiori would necessarily be
et in either ease, we have no means of distinguishing them.

8. Instrumcutul (2).-Homeric Greek: κεφαλῆφιν (with the
head), ἦ-φι βίη-φι (by his might), κρατερῆ-φι βίη·φι (with greater
might) 3 agreeing With the locutive in ἅμ’ ἠόῖ φαινομένη-φι, eb0.;
from ἐσχάρη ἐσχάρᾶ (hearth), ε’σχαρό-φιν (Οᾶ. v. 59, vii. 169)
with analogioal intrusion of the thematic vowel of the ind
declension,

x 9. Bautica—The dative termination -uy (or cy) must have
been contracted in Greek with the final o· of the stem, whence
a termination dy, νεφέλῃενεφέλᾶι, χώρᾳεχώρᾶι. In Latin
apparently this contractiori did not take place,8 so that the
lorm was *terret-ui or *terreret which regularly became territt.
This is the actual archaia form of the dative. Later we find
the dissyllable terrue; can itt have become contracted to uc?
ln the absence of any other evidence this point cannot be
decided; but it is more probahle that terrae is the locative
which will next be discussed, confused with the dative.

10. Lucanae—The terminationes the locutive being -ἳ, the
word χαμαί is generally explained as the locative ofa lost
stem *xiipa- (earth). But χαμαί would presuppose *χαμᾶ·ἴ and,

¹ This iorm is a pseudo-archetem at the time oi the erection ol the

³ Perhaps because it was prevented in Indo-Europum by the presence ol '

an intermediata sound -μ- which is retained in the Sansh it declension, eg.
‹ipsu-yut (to thamara).
