Attio, ἠμφίεσα (Ι clothed), ἐκάθευδε (he was Sleeping), ἐκαθήμην
(Ι was sitting down).1 The opposite analogy, which was
especially common in late Greek, produced the forms ὑπώπτευον,
(Ι was suspecting)‚ προεφήτευσε (he prophesied)‚⁹ and even
διῄτων (Ι was managing), διηκόνουν (Ι was serving), for ε’διαίτων,
ἐδιακόνουν, in which verbs there is really no prefix διά. The
most curicus phenomenon is the addition of both the true
and the false augment in the classica] forms ἠνειχόμην (from
(ἰν-ἔχομαι), ἠντεδίκει, ε’διῄτων (Demeam), ἠμφεσβήτουν (Plato),
ἡντεβόλησε (he met), etc.

REDUPLIOATION.

ξ 1. Form of Redcplicofioa.

(237) Reduplication in Greek may take three forms:
syllable before a consonant, temporal before a vowel,
and syllabic before a vowel. Latin seems to know only
the first form, and even that has become almost obliterated.

(238) Ι. Spllcbic reduplication before ιι consonant consists
essentially in the repetition of the initia] consonant of the verb,
followedby the vowel e: Gk. λέ-λοινα, δέ-δορκ-α, λέ-λυκ-α; Lat.
clod-t, pe-pead-t, pe-pip-t, te-fip-t, occid-t, πυκνὴ the re-
duplication is obscured in sedt=*3e-ad-t=*se-sd-i, root sed,
&kiledei-ata? and the relationes sedeo to secli produced
cent from certic, lapi from ldyo, etc. The principle laid down
will now be examined in its particular applicatione.

1. The vowel of reduplication is always ε in Greek. In
Latin it is often assimilated to the vowel of the verbal root:
ι’ in di-dic-t3 o in poposci, nto-mor-dt (arch. ιιιι-νιιονιί-ῑ), etc.;
ιι in papcpo (from puppo, arch. pre-pupi), tat-tado (from
’(ιιιιάιη,4 eto.

¹ Hom. ἐκαθῖζον (Od. xvi 408).

² There is no verb ’φυτεύω or ’ὀπτεύικ

⁸ (ll. cupro 87, 111, and 90, X.
