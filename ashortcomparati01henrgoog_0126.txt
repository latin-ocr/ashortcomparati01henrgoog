FURTHER GOMBINATIONS OF VOWELS ΛΝΒ CONSONANTS. 8?

nom. fides), illius (also illius), sto by the side of steri (arch
fiere), etc, are but scanty relies showing the former existence

of long vowels in hiatus, a fact attested also by numerous '

scansione in the comio writers,

O.—Iambic words, like duc, show a curicus peculiarity. It
is physically possible to pronounce successively an accented
short vowel and an unaccented long vowel; but, especially ii
the accent is strongly marked, it will be noticed that the long
rowel then tends to scarcely exoeed in length the preceding
short vowel. Hence, in versification previous to the Augustan
age, all words of this kind were treated, at the option of the
writer, either as iambics or pyrrhics, and we find the scansion
νῦριῖενορᾱ, pdtd, otdo, comt, volo, rogo) uma, etc. After-
wcrds analogy both restricted and extended the license ol
Plautus. It restricted it, in that the classical poets, taking
into account the long vowel of spera, craso, horti, cudi,
refused to treat the same vowel as short in putet, loco, domi,
abt; while, on the other hand, the short vowel prevailed and

entirely superseded the long vowel in some very common '

words, utputo, otico, modo (now)=abl. meod, eyo=*e90, Gk.
ἐγώ. On the other hand, it extended it by allowing the
scansion ambo on the model of duo, censeo and sporo on that
of colo, eto.; so that in Latin versification of the decadence
(Martial), every final o of the lst sing. of verbs or nom. sing.
of nouns may be treated citherae long or short.

D.-Every final syllable ending in r, l, m, or t,‘³ shortens its
vowel: patcr=uarvjp ; dator, cf. dolrem locator, cf. gen. honoris
cnd regular nom. honos, Gk. αἰδώς; caimdl=aaimctle3 amor·
(Ι am loved), cf. amo; subj. ambr, amem, cf. amec, aeterum

avocatos, audt35 acc. sing. ratramnum, of. Gk. χώρᾱν; gen.
