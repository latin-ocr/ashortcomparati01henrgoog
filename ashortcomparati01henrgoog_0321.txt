which is very ancient, probably goes back to the distant period
in which there still remained a distinction in the lst plur,

active between a secondary ending *-με and a primary ending
-μες, and it owes its σ to the latter form31 in other words,
-μεθα is secondary, while ·μεσθα is an analogioal primary termi-
nation; then, the two forms being confused, the Greeks used
indifferently ἐφερόμεθα and ε’φερόμεσθα, and also φερόμεσθα and
φερόμεθα.

2. sk. dbcdm, Gk. -σθε for ·d‹=*-df‹. Whatever may be
thought of this last restoration, it is certain that the Greek α
is epenthetio. To explain it, we must go back to the perfect,
in which the same termination -θε is very often preceded by
a dental explosive, which is naturally changed to o: πέπυσθε
(ye know) = *wicred-destinanda *vdmttd-dc, λέλησθεε**λε’-ληθ-θεἲ
etc. Now this σ, which appears in the rest oi the perfect
inflexion, is liable to disappear in the and sing: by reduction
of the group, πέπυσσαι becomes πέπυσαι,2 which is exactly like
λε’λυσαι; nothing more was needed to produce λε’-λυ-σθε,3 and
then a general termination -σθε applicable to all the middle
forms, ε’-τίθε-σθε, ε’-λιξε-σθε. It is a remarkable fact that the
perfect, from which the corruption started, is likewise the only
tense which enables us to discover the corruption, for, nnlike
any of the other tenses, it has sporadically retained the older
termination: thus λε’λειφθε, εἴληφθε cen be explained much
better through *λε’-λειπ-θε, εἴ-ληφ-θε than through *λέ-λειπ-σθε,
*εἴ-ληθσθε, and πέ-φαν-θε (ye have appeared) cannot possibly go
back to *πέφαν-σθε, which would have become *πέφασθε.4

3. In Indo-European probably *wtd after a vowel, *crta
after a consonant, Gk. -ντο and -aroz ἔ-δο-ντο, eride-vro, ε’·φέρο·
ντο, diddo-vro, but Hom. κεί-ατο (they lay)=*xct'y·gtro, in the opt.
θησαί-ατο (Od. xviii. 191), in the plup. astera consonant (old Attio
inser.) ε’-πεπάχ-απο. The forms of the 3rd plur. in -απα are very
common in Homer, so much so indeed that they are found even
in cases where phonetic laws would require the a to remain a
