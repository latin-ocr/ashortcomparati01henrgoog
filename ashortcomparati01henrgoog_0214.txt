from syntecticel componnds in which the first term was in the
locative.1 ¹

‘It- remains to verify these general remarks by examining the
most interesting cases of composition, classified according to
the nature of the nominal stem forming the first term.

1. Boot-sterias rarely show the pure root, d-rlder=*sarerl6os
(root *serra one), ἅπαξ, ἅ-δελφός (from the same womb, uterino
brother), rvpddpoc, ποδήνεμο-ς, Lat. simplem = *serra-plec-S,
sinceras? ossea (bird whose song is an omen), sel-stitiu-m3
almost always withavowel,rrvpolosst'(d)-r (fire-tongs),rrodocrpdssp
(impediment), )(epedvjmy (glove), lacifapvfs vociferati-o, eri-
tota-m, etc.

2. Final esc-The pure stem, but different in each language:
Gk. ἱπποχιιιαχί-ᾶ, ταυρό-μορφο-ς, pared-year, Lat. armi-per, tardi-
grada-8, solli-pes (with uncloven hoof); except in Greek forms
like βαλανηφάγοι and ἀργίπους, and also of course the cases
where the thematic vowel is elided before the initial vowel
of the second term, Gk. lm-aypoc (wild horse), ὑμν-ωδίιῖι,8 Lat.
equ-it· (hersemar), sollemni-s, etc.

3. Final ct—Sometimes in Greek the pure stem, ‹iyyelrd-ddpec
(messenger), νεφελψγερέτα (cloud-gatherer, ἀγείρω); but gene-
rally in Greek and always in Latin the ᾱ is replaced by the
ordinary connecting vowel, χωρο-γράφινς (describing countries), ’
ὡρινλόγιιν (clock), eard-piper (imitating the voice), spici-fer,
spici-per, veli-volas, tabi-cea=*tcble-cea (tibia caecas), etc*

4. Final s-The pure stem sometimes in Greek, roll-trophos
(sacher of citios), and always in Latin3 auceps, au-yrtrium,
adspiciam, etc, syncopated for aviceps, etc.; apilio (shep-
herd)=*0u-pili6 syncopated for ovi-3 cyrri-comus, whence by
imitation lapi-orda (stem lapid) moaci-capas, ponti-sea, etc.
