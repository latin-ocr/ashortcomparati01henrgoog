without any addition, and this iswhat actually happens in many
cases3 but, just as in derivation certain suffixes were amalga-
mated with the terminationes the stems to which they were
added, and were· then under this new form introduced into
other stems not containing this termination, so also in compo

' eition it was inevitable that such a vowel, when occurring

usually or frequently at the end oi the first stem, should'pass
by analogy into formatione where it had no etymologica] justi·
¹fication.

It is essentially the thematic vowel elo, the enormous ex*
pansion of which in derivation hasbeen already established,
that thus plays the part of an epenthetic or connecting vowel
in compounds. In fact in both languages the stems in eso are
almost as numerous as all the rest put together. When they
form the first terms of compounds, their final vowel regularly
takes the form o in Greek, c (changed to t) in Latin, horo
κτόνο-ς, magnifica-est and this Greek 0, Latin a· has been ex-
tended by analogy to a host of other nomina] stems with quite
different endings. This extension was aided by the fact that in
both languages the vowel in questionuwas also the sign of the
genitive singular of the same stems, and so the linguistio con·
sciousness instinctively translated superlativas (stem πυμ) by
wopis κλοπεύς and paci-fictas (stem pac) by pacis factor.

Latin knows no other connecting vowel besides i (a). Greek
has some others besides o, but they are much rarer. Thus some
stems in -ᾶ, preserving their final letter unohanged in compo-
sition, ey. δαφνη-φόρινς (bearing laurels), contaminated other
. stems, and hence arose, aided especially by the rhythmioal law ’
which made the Greeks avoid three short syllables following
one another, the curione forms, στεφανψφόρο-ς (bricteros,
crown), βαλανη-φάγο-ς (stiliano-3, acorn), ἔκη-βόλψς (e‘xricfar),
which were extended by the poets in so far as they favoured

' the dactylio matre. Much less clear is the origin of the con·
’ neoting vowel ι in ἀργί-πους (ἀργά-ς, white), rolli-Opi} (κῖιλός or .
rather *κᾶλλό-ς, beautiful); but it may have been borrowed
