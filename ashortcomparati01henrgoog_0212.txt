short, oxytone if it is long: θεοτόκος (mother of God), cf.
θεότοκος (son of God), πυρφόρος, λογογράφος; ῥυθμοποιός, ῥαψῳδός.
This distinction, which is peculiar to Greek, seems to be
partly a new development.

(178) This is regulated by one main principle; there are
no compound verbe. These which are wrongly called by this
name in Greek and Latin are either (1) formed by the mere
juxtaposition of two clemente, a preposition and a verb, whose
union is very loose, since they can always be separated, the
augment and reduplication perpetually come between them,
and in Homer and old Latin one may occur at the beginning
of asentenoe and the other at the end, in short, the common
type δια-βαίνω, tamenim or (2) they are verbs derived from
(tompound nouns; thus ἀτυχέω, δυσχεραίνω, ἅτῖμάω, δρῦφακτόω (to
fonce with wood), insanio (to be mad), demente (to make mad),

terrifico, etc, are not compound verbs formed from simple

verbs *τυχέω, *χεραίνω, ripole), ete, Which indeed for the most,
part do not exist, but verbal derivatives formed, regularly or
irregularly, from the nominal stema ἀτυχής, δυσχερής, ἅτῑμος,
δρύφακτος, ansanus, demens, termflcosst and it would be easy
to give many other examples.

Hence it follows that the last term of a compound is always
a nominal stem. The first may be a nomina] stem, or an in·-
declinable particle, or, in Greek only, a verbal stem. We have-
to consider each of these cases separately.

that, as a general principle, it must assume the thematis form

¹ ’Ario (not to honour), il not a mere barbarism, is the only verbal eom-
pound in Greek3 and it is easy to see the analogy to whioh it is dus, ἀτίω :
rlo=drsudoz τῖμάω. similarly, in Latin, ἰρηῦεσῦ (to forget, forgive) is.
modelled on tynotaa. The common type desquamo (to scale), aderato, ec-
pectora, eta, is modelled, lor example, on aqadma and the relation ol turba
to detorto (tha latter being a combination of de and turbo).
