XXX CONVENTIONAL siuns

The sign ot equality between two forms implies their identity: otpn=
sero. When used in conjunctius with the sign (t), it denotas aproportion,
e.g., urbibus ε arbi=avibua : ovi (to be read ‘¹ arbium isto urbicensibus is
to ooi’').

An asterisk betore a torm denotas that it is not actually iound, but is
restored by conjecture.

Ahyphen, placed before or atter a torm, denotas a torm which never
appears by itseli in language, namely, either a suffix separated irum its ν
stem, or a stem deprived oi its suffix: ap. -μεν, termination oi the lst per·
son plural oi Greek verbs, etp-c, stem oi the verb φέρω.

In Sanskrit transcriptions,a line above a vowel denotas an unaccented
long vowel, lrlidrciun‘ (1 bear); the circumflex accent denotas au accented
long vowel, vecla (I know); c andp¹ are to be pronounced like English cb
and j respectively; l is always equivalent to English sb3¹ the cerebrals
(cacuminals) are denoted by a dot underneath the letterin question, ag. c.

In Greek, the quantity is marked throughout (ἔλῦσα), except when it
coincides with the acuent, in which case it has generally been thought best
to sacrifice it to the accentuation (ἐλύσαμεν). ’

The work hasbeen divided into 300 sections, each oi which torma as
homogeneous a whole as possible. It is to thess that all the references
introduced by the words snpra and infra retes.
