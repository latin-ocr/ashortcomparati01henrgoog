the diphthong ci, it is reduced, as in Greek, to a simple c, eq}uo
=*equoi=imrp.
Ei was perhaps already pronounced 1, even when s ill
written ci: nmnmuws=diffidene. In the Augustan age tlhe
' spelling was merely altered to agree with the pronunciationl

Au was etrus diphthong, and hes remained such in Pro-
venoal, Portuguese, and Ronmanian3 which proves that tre
very frequent interchange of 111 and ὁ, revealed by inscriptio ns
and manuscripts,1 is to be regarded merely as adialectircal
peculiarity. i

The old 111 became ou, hence there is no 111 in Latin, exdept
that which arises from the later contractiori of 1111, 1111111111
mere fact of its having this origin is enough to show its {oro-
nunciation. 1

The old cu, whether primitive or derived from 111, 11111111-
haps already pronounced 11 even when the spelling 011 still
survived(hnn0uc1r, Ep scip). Later on it was superseded hy
the spelling 11.

The diphthongs 1n which the semr— -vowel comes first 1(1ἀ111,
coel, etc. ) present no difficulty. But it must be observed that
there were many more of these 1n the popular speech than 111
the slow and studied pronunciation of classioal Latin; for ex-
ample, the classioal Latin 1111111111, a tetrasyllable, was in popular

- Latin 1111111111, a tribrach, which, through the first syllable being
long by position, became a dactyl, and the poets made use of
this license to introduce words of this class into their verses
In the same way the popular words 5111111111, trifolium, are
shown to be trisyllables (with accent on' bc, 111) by the Frenoh
5111111, trcy‘le, which could not come from bellatore, infelicem.
The double scansione 11111111 and lancie, 91111111 and 9111111111
well known. Such a change is very natural. Similarly the

’ Frenoh termination -tion is monosyllabic in current speech, but

dissyllabic in poetry.3
