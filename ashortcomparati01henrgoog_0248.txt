OHAPTER II.
IMPARISYLLABIG DEGLENSION.

(198) To avoid any confusion, it will be hest in this declen-
sion to carefully distinguish and study separately, first the
terminatione themselves, and next the various forms which
the stem may take in consequence 61 the addition 61 these
terminations. This distinction is possible, and even easy, in
every case except the nominative singular 61 the masculinas
, and femininos, in which the modification 61 the stem is often

the only sign of 1116 6666. Hence this fundamental case must
be considered first.

(199) We have seen that the nom. sing. is sometimes char-
acterized by the termination -6, while sometimes it has no affix
at all.1 This variation is reproduced here on a very large
scale, and nominatives may be distinguished as sigmatic, ep.
φλέψ, θρίξ, and non-sigmatic, namely, 'those in which the only
apparent case-sign is a lengthening 61 the final syllable 61 the
stem, ep. φέρων, πατήρ. Formerly this lengthening was ex-
plained as being simply the result 61 611 older -s, which had
been lost with compensatory lengthening. But this hypothesis
cannot be maintained, since it violatos phonetic laws; 161 11 is
clear that, if well attested sigmatic nominatives like *διδόντ-ς,
gip-s (historically proved), have become διδούς, χείρ, eto, then
the supposed 1611116*φέρ6ντ-ς, *πατέρ-ς could only have become
.*φέρους, *πατείρ, not φέρων, πατήρ. Moreover, none 611116 Indo·
