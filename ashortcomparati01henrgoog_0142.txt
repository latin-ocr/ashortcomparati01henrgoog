>(85) Α stem is called nominat, ep. λόγῳ or verbal, ay.
tipo, according as itis capable of attaching to itself the
terminatione of declension or of conjugation respectively.
These two grammatical categorias are in principle quite dis-

tinet,l but they cannot fail to react on one another, thus ,

mutually enriching each other. Thus 'from ἐκ-καλέ-ω, to eall
forth (ἔκ-κέ-κλψκ-α, ἐξ-ε-κλή-θη, ἔκ-κλη-το-ς, etc), the language
formed ἕκ-κλη-σί-ᾶ, assembly; from this noun, the verb e’x-xlp
σι-άζω, to hold an assembly, and from this verb in its turn the
substantive ἐκ-κλψσι-ασ·τή-ς, orator, and the adjective ε’κ-κλη-σι-
ucerini-r, and theoretioally the process might be continued up
to infinity. But, as in every language there are more noune
derived from verbs than verbs derived from noune, it seems
most natural, in approaching the study of the two systems
of derivation, to consider the verbal stems first.

Furthermore, in each system of derivatim, the formatione
may be distinguished, according as they go back to the Indo-
European period, or are peculiar either to Greek or Latin, and
seem to have been subsequently developed in either language. ·
No doubt in the latter case they are not, properly speaking,
primary3 for even when they seem to have arisen from the
simple combination oia root and a suffix, yet, having arisen at “
a time when root and suffix hed long ceased to exist as separate
categorias, they can only be due to a secondary and often a
very complicated operation of analogy. But, on the one hand,
as we have just seen, there is scarcely any Indo-European form

¹ Thetis to say, λόγος is no more derived from λέγω than λέγω from lipom
but both come, bya separate and independent process oi derivatim, from
a root *teg which appears in its normal lorm in the one case, und iu its
deflected lorm in the other.
