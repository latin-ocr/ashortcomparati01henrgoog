AEolians for μετά (with) and would correspond to Lat. ped-d.
In πάντ-η, Dor. παντ-ἃ, the long vowel at the end is due to the
analogy of the parisyllabic declension.l

10. Instrumentcl (2).—Only a few examples in Homer: ἶφι =
*ft-cr, of. Lat. ‘rii-8, &pilleo-pir, ὄχεσφιν. In Latin only i-bi and
ubl (from a demonstrative stem llic, cf. uter), with a final
lengtheningof obscure origin.2

11. Dotion-The Indo-European termination was probably
loy, which reappears in Greek in the two types of infinitivo

represented by δόμεν-αι and le'v-uui most probably also in χαμ-αί, ¹

dative of χθών. Possibly a faint reminiscence of it is to be
traoed in Homeric locatives ending in a long vowel, such as
πατέρῐ, κόρυθῐ, νηῖ, which would thus combine the -ι of the loca· ,
tive with the long quantity of the dative. » ¹Elverywhere else in
Greek the dative has disappeared‚ being entirely superseded by
the locative. In Latin, on the contrary, itis the dative which
has prevailed and which is found in all stems of the 3rd and
· tth demensione, manui (often replaced by the abl. mana, espe-
cially in ansar),⁴ ped-t, patr-i, uictor-t, nontin-t, etc. The

spellings ped—ei and ped-e are also found. In istems, the
final -ῑ was naturally contracted with that of the stem (ουῑε
*ovi-t or *cury-t), and, starting from the purely external resem-

blance between ovi and pedt,·analogy assimilated to one another
many oi the terminatione of istene and consonantal stema, ao&
like pede, pedes like ovea, etc.

12. Locctive (1) (no termination).—This case appeare, not
only in infinitives like δόμεν and insinuator but in αἰές (Dor),
locutive of a stem of which αἰεί (Hom), ἀεί (Att.)=*atfeo-r is
the locative in -ι, as well as in αἰέν (Ion.) from a stem *atfffi .

13. Locotive (ui-The termination is -ἲε Gk. πόλε-ι, dore-i,
ἰχθύ-ι, rod-i, ποιμέν-ι, ὀνόματ-ι, πατρ-ί, δοτῆρ·ι, δῶτορ-ι, albei:
*aiddu-r, γένειθγένεσ-ι, etc. In Latin, though it does not seem
so at first sight, this case has been preserved almost equally
