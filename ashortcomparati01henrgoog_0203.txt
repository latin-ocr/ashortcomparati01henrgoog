(166) Ι. Sufficc -fdc, later -ότ-τ forms the participles of all
perfecte in ·κ-; λε-λυ-κ-ότ· (λελυκώς), hepid-pmii·- (πεφιληκώς),
fem. λελυκυῖα, etc.

(167) H. Safflces -feaoe, -Ὲεν, of infinitives.-The first is
added under the form -ένιιι to perfect stems, λε-λοιπ-έναι, λε·λυκ-
έναι, and under the shortened form ·νιιι3 to the stems of presente
in ·νυ-α11(1-να-,δεικ·νύ·ναι,δαμ-νά-ναι, and of aorists passive, τυπ-ἣ-
ναι, lece-va, etc. The second is the usual termination of the
infinitives of thematio forms, ep. *he'ye-fev *λέγε-εν λέγειν and
*λιπ-έ-Ἑεν λιπ-ἔ-εν λιπεῖν. It is really λιπέεν which should be
read wherever the Homerio poems show as the second aorist
infinitiva the impossible form λιπέειν, in which thetermination
-ειν cannot be explained; in most places this correction leaves
the metre unchanged‚ inasmuch as the final short syllable is
followedby an initial consonant, and so becomes long by posi-
tion; in the few cases where this is not so, the syllable is
lengthened through the caesura.4 In Lesbian, the εε seems to
be contracted to η, λείπην λίπην. But the short final syllable in
Dorio, ἄγεν, φέρεν, ἔχεν, λιπέν, is embarrassing3 the most probable
explanationis that here also the contraction to η took place
(Lacon. σιγῆνε θιγεῖν), and that the vowel was afterwards short-
ened on the analogy of the conjugated forms of the present
(and pers. sing. φέρες, ἆγες, etc.) In the contracted verbs we
have ettheiv=*elth-c'-e-ev‚ τῑμᾶνε*τῐ·μά·ε·εν, δηλοῦν-τ*δη-λό-ε·εν,
etc.5

wellin Pompeii.

⁸ Of supra 130. Ἴ

⁴ The spelling λιπέειν is due to a comparison ol the two periepomene
λιπεῖν and φιλεῖν, the latter ol which is contreeted from φιλέειν.

⁶ The 1ηαοτ.ἱιι6υἰιίνοππῆπιιιεστᾶ-σ-ιιι (subsidiarily λῦσαι, φιλῆσαι, eto.)
is evidently the dative of the seme stem ol which etdrc='etd·e·t is the
locative. Of.supra 125. ι
