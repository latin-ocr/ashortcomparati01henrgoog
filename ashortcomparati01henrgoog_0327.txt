(266) After the three verbal categorias 01 voice, number,
and person, it only remains for us 10 study those ostense and
mood. Tense is the relation of past, present, or future,
affecting the verbal concept. This relation itself is susceptible
of 0 large number 01 different shades of meaning: for example,
a past fact may be regarded from the point 01 view 01 its oon-
sequences in the present, “ he is dead,’' Gk. τέθνηκε, 00 solely
as past, in order to state it and detail the circumstances of it:
“hs died yesterday at six o'clock,'' Gk. ἔθανε; 1100 present,
again, may 01010 00 actual and momentary fact, “ I say U,'' or
0 habit, “I smoke very little,’' or 0 general property, “man
speaks,'’ to say nothing 01 1100 present 00 01100 00οᾶ as a future,
·‘ I am going this evening,” Gk. εἶμι (Ι shall go). The languages
with which we 000 concerned are far from having 0 special form
1000001001 110000 delicate shcdes 01 meaning; these shades 01
meaning 000 deduced from the 1000 01 1100 speaker and from
the sentence taken 00 0 whole. On the other hand, in each
tense, the 1001 expressed by the verb may be thought of either
as constant and positively affirmed, 00 as eventual and
relative, or as simply desired and subordinate, or, lastly, as
obligatory and commanded: to these distinctions correspond
the four moods, indicative, subjunctive, optative, and ⁴impera-
tive, the only moods known to the Indo-European languages.1
