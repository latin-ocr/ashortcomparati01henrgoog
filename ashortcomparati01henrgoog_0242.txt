2. Oblique ane (1) (Greek): wanting in Homer, later the
rare type χώραιν, which is evidently modelled on ἴπποιν. ’
’3, oblique ane (2) (Latin), duchac, ιιιιιοιῑοιιιι.1

(195) HI. Plorat-1. Nominctive-Vccotive.-The ordinary
termination *ec hy contractiori with the thematic vowel ᾱ,
produced a termination de, attested by Sk. dpvds (mares) as
well as by Oscan and Umbrian. But Greek and Latin seem to
have lost this case and to have replaced it bytho nominative
duel: νεφέλαι, χῶραι like Sk. apoc ,· Lat. equae· terroe, like
duae, aaabae. ’

⁴ 2. Accusatioe: *aa-Gk. *χώρᾶ-νς (we read in Cretan τὰνς
τῐμάιις, etc), whence Lesb. χώραις, Dor.·Ion.·Att. χώρᾶς, ιεοιοο-
times simply the short vowel, τὰς θύρᾶς (Theocr.) 3² Lat. terras
:vermos The demonstrative -δε added to a few accusa-
tives of this class formed an illative in -ιῑζε, ay. θύραζεε*θύρᾶ·
νιν-δε (towards the doors, cf. Lat. foras), Ἀθήναζε, etc, and this
termination -αζε was afterwards emended, with the same
iunctim, tc noune whose very meaning excludes the possibility
of their use in the plural, cy. χαμάζε and χαμᾶζε (to the
ground).

3. Instrumental: Homer. θύρη-φιν, κλισὶη.φιν, elo. ’

4. Dativc-Ahlative(l).—-There isin Sanskrit nc type corre-
sponding to the dative-ablativos in -αις and -ῐε, χώραις, terrea,
and this type is wanting even in Homeric Greek. These facts
lead one to think that Greek and Latin each developed it
separately cn the analogy of ἵπποις *equcie (terris:terrais).³⁴

5. Dative-Ablotive (2).-There is nothing to justify the
opinion that the Latin forms deabus, filiabus, libertatico,

. amnibus demiratus (Liv. Andr.) are new formatione. Sanskrit
has an instr. pl. epod-this, a dat-abl. pl. epod-blegne and an v
instr.-dat.-abl. dual dpvdbhycm, all three of which approxi-
mately correspcnd tc the Latin form* Still, if this form is
of IndoEuropean origin, it was only kept in the case ofa

¹ Supra 188, 3 and infra 195, 5.

¹ Eg. Syrenas. 65, like τὸς θεὸς, snpra 189. 2.

⁸ The dative in -ηις, which is very common in Homer, (κοίλῃς νηυσί, ΙΙ. ἰ.
89) shows in ite termination the influence oi the locative in ·ηισι (infra),
with which it is used interchangeably.
