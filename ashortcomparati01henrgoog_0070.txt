VOWEI.S AND DIPHTHONGS OF THE TWO LANGUAGES VIEWED IN
RELATION ΤΟ THEIR GOMMON ORlGIN.

(27) The study of the diphthongo in which the vowel comes
, first cannot be separated from that of the vowel itseli ς on the
other hand, the stud)⁷ of the diphthongs in which the semi-
vowel comes first depends entirely on the development of the
semi-vowel which they contain.
Hence this section will be divided-under two heads: (1)
vowels (2) semi-vowels.

(28) The vocalism which we have assigned to Greek and
Latin is the sameas the primitive Indo-European vocalism,
Nwhich these languages reprodnca‚ as a general rule, with
rhmarkable fidelity. To simplify their study‚ it will be ''con-
valiient to arrange the vowels in the following order: i, i, u, ἰἰ,
chamaal -
1.) Lm. t=ek r=Laa t: Ι.-Ε. *qi-s (interrog), Gk. τί-ς, Lat.
qui-83 *avt (three), τρι-σίν, tri-btts; ·i·‚ formative suffix of sub-
stantives, *ow-ic (sheep), οἶς-τ*ὅῈ-ι-ς, ov-i·s; -t, locative ending,
Gk. νυκτ-ἳ, narr-i, Lat. rar-d, ποθί-ἔ, etc.

We see from the last exemplos that Latssfinalt becomes e:
rtirc=*rriri; so also the neuters recedant (cs. masc. levis)
and marc, which correspond to the Greek types ἵδρϊ (uenter of
adj. ἵδρι-ς, “knowing’' ), σίναπι, etc, as is shown by the cases
in which the i reappears abl. sing. teor, nom.¹ pl. levia. The
same change of t to e takes place before r: Lat. sero (Ι sow)=
'lsi-sd,2 cf. Gk. ἷημι-τ*σί-ση-μι.

(29) 2. Ι.-Ε. r=Gk i=Lat t: *wt- (force), Gk. ἴς (force,

kk

¹ Besides these ten voweh, comparativa philology assigna to the primi·
tive language an eleventh vowel oi indeterminate pronunciation [e], which
in Greek and Latin however appears to be entirely confused with ᾰ.

⁹ Lat. a between two vowels always becomes r. Οἱ course most ot these
examples presuppose an acquaintance with phonetic lawe which will only be
set forth later on. Phonologyformsasystem which must begrasped asa
whole before each part orit can be understood. [Oi. infra 69, 1 and nota]
