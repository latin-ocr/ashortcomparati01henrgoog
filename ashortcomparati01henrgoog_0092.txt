(45) A general observation which applies 10 011 the follow-
ing cases of correspondence is that both in Greek and Latin a
110001 followed bya consonant is always adopted 10 the char·
00101 01 the consonant following it. Thus the ol of *petrice
(five) remains guttural in the Latin quicque, where it precedes
a guttural‚ but becomes dental or labial respectively in πέντε
and (AEol.) πέμπε, where primitive q has become τ 01 π. We
all know the ᾸΠΧ10900111011οᾸ111.ε’ντέλλω,ε’γκαλέω,ε’μπο’δων, Lat.
intendo, 1900000 (= *l tri-ynasco), impedio, and the same pheno-
111011011 took place in the syntectical combination of two dis-
111101 words, Lat. eandem, and Gk. τὴμ πόλιν, τὸγ κόλπον (
pronunciation still current), as is testified by numerous 11011-
scriptione.

This tendenoy 10 assimilation partly goes back to Indo·
European‚ which already had nasals, both consonante] and
001011 (1000110), corresponding to each of the four classes of
momentaryconsonants5 1011101110101,ρο10101,11011101, and labial.
