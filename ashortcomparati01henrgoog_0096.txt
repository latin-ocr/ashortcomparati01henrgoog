Besides the short nasal sonants, IndoEuropean certainly pos·
sessed long nasal sonante? the origin ol which, and the laws
regulating their correspondence, have not yet been entirely
elucidated. [Ep. initially Gk. νᾶ (Ion-Att. νη), Lat. ou, νη-

(50) IndoEuropean had the two liquids r and l, which were
sometimes confused in the daughter languages, but are repro-
* duced in Greek and Latin with considerable exactness.

The following are the only modifications:

1. Epenthesis.-A. In Greek, the pronunciation of initial
r, and sometimes of initia] l, develops a prothetic vowel ol inde·
terminate character, α, ο, ε; ep. ἐρυθρός and ruber, ἐλεύθερος and
liber, ἀλείφω (to anoint) aud adv. λίπα,3 ὀρέγω (to stretch, direct)
and repo-B. In Latin, a guttural or labial followed by l
develops an intermediate labial epenthesis: cl. saeclum and
soeculum, acc. populum = Umbr. poplom, Old Lat. poploe

¹It will be noticed that tin Latin, in syllables containing nasale, the
reduced degree cannot differ from the hormul form.

2 Discovered by F de Saussure.

³ The alternate presence and absence ol prothesis must be due to the
exi» tence of syntectical doublets.
