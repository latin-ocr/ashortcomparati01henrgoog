added to certain terminatione in ι and ε, λέγουσιν, τείχεσιν, ἔθηκεν,
is not, properly speaking, a case of epenthesis. Its originis
somewhat obscure. The most probable explanation is that this
final ν, which is etymologioal in certain formatione-ay. perhaps
in the loo. pl. ποσσίν, innotata-passed by analogy into others,
in which it was afterwards regarded as euphonia. Originally
it was certainly not so; in inscriptions, it is often absent in
hiatus, and is ,also often found before a consonant; moreover, it
is found in positione where, if pronounced, it would have spoilt
the rnetre.1

The cases of epenthesis in Latin are ιιιιὶιιιροιιιιιι.2

2. Spacope. The most noteworthy case of syncope, in both
languages, is thatin which two syllables which are identical, or
at least contain the same consonante, follow one another in the
body of a word, in this case the first syllable generally dis-
appears: Gk. ἧμέδιμνονεὴμι-μέδιμνον, ἀμφορεύςτ-ἆμφι-φορεύς (jar
with two handles); Lat. pereffluam-trax, stipendium:
*stipi-peculum? etc. We need not lay stress on a phenomenon
so universal and easy to understand, but from its very nature
sporadic.

There is hardly any other case of syncope in Greek, except
in the final syllable >of certain proclitic prepositions; ap. *aar

¹ εκατά in κάππεσε, κάββαλε, ἂμ πολιντάνὰ πόλιν, πὰρ Διός, etc.

This process was carried much further in Latin: ub=da6, sub
εὖπό, ρθνεπερί, ειν-ἔτι, ιιεο;ιιθριιθ, and even extended to
three imperative endings, dic, dato, foc.

In the body of Latin words, syncope of unaccented vowels is
frequent, especially in popular pronunciation,4 in consequence
of the stress laid on the accented syllable. As examples may
be mentioned ualidus and ualde, calidus and caldae, auceps
=*auiceps, claudo=*clltvi-olo⁵; sarpa, porpo=*subre96, etc,
