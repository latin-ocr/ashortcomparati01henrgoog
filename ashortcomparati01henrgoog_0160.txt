IV. Stoma with suffia -v· and -u-: Latin perfecta-All the
Latin perfecte which are not primitive (87) and are not to be ,
referred to the sigmatic aorist (96), are formed by means cf
this suffix -o- or aa, the origin of which is obscure: ricc-t,
vic-v-t, sto-t ; sec-ut, colat-t, year-ut, etc. lt hes been sup-
posed that these suffixes represent a syncopated form of sut
added to the verbal root. This hypothesis was supported

’ chiefly by the perfect potat, which, on account of possum:
*pot-scor might perhaps seem as if it ought to go back to ¹
*pot-su-t5 but everywhere else, and even in this case itself, this
view involves serious phonetic difficulties. It is perhaps more
likely that the c or u started from certain perfect forms in
which it belonged to the root itself‚ eg: caco-t (cf. the pres.
mco-ec), and thence spread throughout the rest of the conjuga-
tional system,l especially in verbs of secondary derivation.

(105) V. Stenas with suffla -sr'e- (re- aftcr c corccl):
imperfect subjunctives ‹es-secu (es-scs), arch. faoecm(?)‚ arc-ra,
dare-ro, stoream-These formatioris have nothing correspond-
ing to them in Greek except in the futures and aorists sub
junctive witha short vowel (βή-σο-μεν), which have already
been connected with the Latin forms represented byfcoco.
Now a form *essa for example (=Gk. ἔσ-σο-μαι, later ἔσομαι),
must have been conjugated *esec *esses *essct whence, if the -
vowel remained short, *cesta esstt (of. Lat. facit), or, if it was
lengthened owing to some corruption, esses. It remains to find
the influence which lengthened the termination. This may he
the influence of the termination of the old Latin subjunctives
afterwards used as futures, in which the termination was long
because it arose from a contreoticn (irrfho 143); in other
words, *scores would become *forces through the analogy of r
facies (thou wilt do). In this somewhat complicated way the
Latin subjunctive may be connected with a proethnic category,
into which however both Greek and Latin introduced consider·
able modificatione.

¹ Thus rocci: octus=mcviz motus—In forms like oraui (rare) from nec-tt,
there is an analogical combination ot the two signs -o- and -o·.
