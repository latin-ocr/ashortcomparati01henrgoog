208 onaan nun uerno urrunnu.

an adjective prosper3 hence the acc, was *sper-em, but the

analogy of diem, rem, nubem produced spem, and then the
reat of the declension followed in the same direction. It would
have been equally possible to decline nubes *nubet tuobe, and
if this did not happen, there is no lach of attempta in this
direction3 for sames (gen. samis) has in the abl. same instead
of fame, tabee (consumption) has an old abl. taba or rather
tabo, and tobes (stain) an old abl. labi (Lucr.) which is doubtÎ‡
lese only another mode of writing *labe

Hence we see what has taken placeÍ¾ when once dies, rea,
epos, etc, had passed into the 5111 declension, the nominative
of the speeiem, etc, whatever ite original form, had to conform

> to their likenesa
