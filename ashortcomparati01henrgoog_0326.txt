The same objection and many others even more serious from
. the standpoint of scientifio phonology‚ must lead us to reject the
old theory (correct from a merely grammatical point of view),l
which explained the middle through the agglutination of the
reflexive pronominal clement se (ocho-r=*veho ec, etc). All
that we can affirm with certainty at present is that Sanskrit
also has some middle terminatione in r, without even attempt-
ing to enter into details in regard to the manifold corruptions
which Sanskrit on the one hand and Latin on the other must
have introduced into the primitive type.2

However this may be, it is certain that from the paradigni ·
lopo-r, lege-re lege-rie, legi-terr, legi-mur, legi-mint, loqu-ntor,
the Latin langnage abstracted terminatione which it transferred
unchanged to the subjunctiveS, futures, and imperfecte. The
perfect and the tenses derived from it were supplied by peri·
phrastic expressions, lectus sum or fui, etc.

With the single exception of tepere, the imperative was
likewise formed analogically: 2nd sing. lege-re, and legi-tor on
the model of ἱερῆα 3rd sing. legi-tom 2nd plur. legimiat(eetc);
3rd plur. lege-ntor on the model of legunto. In old Latin there
is also a form of the 2nd and 3rd sing. feminal modelled ap-
proximately on femini and the relation of este to estc.

ttfirseraon. x. p. 449) has thought that the Latin mediopassive can be
entirely explained from Celtic. But, though his view reete on a large
number ot plausible data, it cannot be accepted in its entirety.
