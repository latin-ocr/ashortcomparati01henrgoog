OOMPOSI'HON.

(177) From the point of view of their function or meaning,
compounds may be distinguished as copulative, deter-
minative and possessive.

I. A copulative compound is one in which neither oi the
terms determines the meaning of the other, but both, being
placed as it were on the same footing, retain in composition
the meaning and the function which they would have if used
separately. This class, which has been immensely developed
in Sanskrit, cy. dual Mitto-caratiae (Mitra and Varuna) has
scarcely any representatives in Greek: νυχθ-ήμερον (night and
day), popo-rrteot-rppos (ointment made oi scented cil, pitoh,
and wax).¹ In Latin we may quote scote-taurana (solemn
sacrifice of oswine, a sheep, and a bull).

Π. Α determinative compound is one which is equivalent
in meaning to aphrase in which one of the two terms would
be put in a certain case, as being subordinate to the other.

This class in its turn comprises (1) attributive or apposi-

tive, and (2) dependent compounds.

1. In an attributive compound, the first term is the attri-
bute of 'the second and would consequently in a syntectical
phrase be put into the same case :2 μεγαλό-πολι-ς, «campteras
(unlucky maiden), &tipo-rrum (male child), λογ·αοιδ-ικό-ς (oon-
nected with speech and singing), the exact equivalents of
μεγάλη πόλις, κακὴ παρθένος, παῖς ἀνήρ, et0.; Latin (very rare)
meredic-s corrupted for *meotidis-s? equivalent to media
dics.

2. In a dependerit· compound, one of the terme is dependent
on the other and hence in a syntactioal phrase would he in
an oblique case, provided that it is declinable. This class in·
eludes :-(a) compounds in which the first term is nominat and

¹ There are also the burlesque compounds created by Aristophanes, ep.
Τῑσαμενοφαινίππους “Tisamenes and Phaenippus’'‚ Actori. 603, etc.—

Ἀνδρὶγυνος is un appositive, and κλαυσιγέλως (mur cuca fletu) adependent ,

ῦοῗιξίοὶῗὶἓᾱῇοηεερουᾶε to the Frenoh type porte-senice, uapore-salon, blen-
νυνί, except that in Fren'ch the last term is the determining one.

⁸The substitution of r lor d is perhaps due to an old locative phrase
'tritri did, “in full day.''
