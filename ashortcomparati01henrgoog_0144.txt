the present seems which Greek still kept in their primitive
simple form; so that the regular correspondente between the
two languages would seem to be broken from the very begin·
ning, if we trusted merely to appearanoes. ,

(87) I. Simple root-steens (in Greek, present stems, or more

commonly aorist seems, when the stem of the present is formed
by means of reduplication, infru II).—The simple root with
no affix immediately precedes the termination, end appears
either in the normal or weakened form, according to e reguler
alternation (sometimes however, interfered with by analogy),
which will be considered among the phenomena of conjugation.l
Prosents τ’ φη-μί φα-μέν (root φᾶ, Dor. ‹bd-pf), εἶ-μί ἵ-μεν; εἰ-μί,
Lesb. ἔμ-μι (--*ε’σ-μί) ἔσ-μέν. Aorists: ἔ-θη·ν ἔ-θε-μεν, ἕ-δων
ἔ-δο-μεν, {erp-v (Dor. ἔ-στᾱ-ν) ἔ-στη-μεν, etc.

Latin has in this class: es, es-t, es-tis, etc, from the verb es-sc,
root ee; eet (he sets) :fed-t, root ed3 eol-t (he wishes), etc.;
e-s, i-t, the present of the verb tre, except lst sing. and 3rd
pl, which are thematic; that of the verb dere, except d65
perhaps that of the verb std-re, except sto (ετᾱ-εεέ-στᾱ-ς, except
in respect of the augment); and by e curious peculiarity some
forms of a verb which in Greek, on the contrary, is entirely
thematic, fer-e, fer-t, fer-tis, fer-te, cf. φέρεις, φέρει, φέρε-τε.
But the Homeric form piper (Il. ix. 171) is no doubt a relic of
the old non-thematic conjugation of the root φερ.

II. Boot-stenes· preceded by reduplication with tbe vowel i(in
Greek present and imperfect stems, in Latin lost).—The‘ root
alternatos: τί-θη-μι τί-θε-μεν, dorp-yet Dor. ἴ·στᾶ·μι (ε*σί-στᾱ-μκ,)
ἷ-στα-μεν, tete-pr, ἴ-η-μι (def-eme, cf. Lat. sewen), impf.
(κη’-θηψ ἐ-τί-θε-μεν, etc.; with so called Attio reduplication
(infre 240), ὀνίνημι (to benefit), aer. ὠνάμην. In Latin ei-sto
(=Gk. ivry-pi) and bebo (=Sk. pi-bdmei) have passed into the
thematic conjugation.

ΙΠ. Boot-sterne preceded ey reduplication with the voeoele ,

(perfect stems, improperly called in, Greek second perfecte).-

1 The same vowel-gradation takes place in every syllable, whether a root-
sylleble or eumz-syllable, which immediately precedes the conjugation-
ending, and does not eontein the thematic elo. cf. infru 269.

erue ordinary grammers heve been very unfortunate in their nomen-
clature3 the so-eelled second perfecte ere much more simple and primitive
