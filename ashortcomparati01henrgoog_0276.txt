11 of the suffix 11 reflected in the root, etc. But in most
neuters in ·αρ and αρ analogy has assimilated the oblique cases
to 1111 nom: θέναρ (palm of the hand) θέναρ-ος, ἔαρ (spring)
ἔαρος (ἦρ ἧρ-ος), Several also are indeclinable. ’

In Latin especially this analogical processuras considerably
developed. From the primitive declension femur femin-is,
Latin derived, on the one hand, the gen. femor-is and the other
oblique cases resembling it, on the other, the nom. sing. femen.
Similarly the declension jecur *jacio-is became jecur jecor-is ,·
but the lost form 11111111- 11 still survives in 1111 ourious genitive
1161111111 in which both suffixos appear. Ι111,11 say the
least, very probable that 1111 must have had a genitive ’111111- -11,
but the 1111111111 gave rise to a genitive 1111-11(1111111(1 by
the grammarians)‚ then the joint influence of these two forms
produced the ordinary genitive 1111111-11, which in turn gave

1111 to a little used nominative itiner. This accumulation of K

suffixes is not unknown to Greek: thus ὄναρ (dream) has the
genitive ὀνείρατ-ος,1 form which, spart from the vocalism and
the addition of τ, 11 the exact counterpart of 11111111111111111-11,
with the two suffixos arranged' 111 the opposite order. It was
inevitable that confusions of all kinds should arise in (1111111-
sions having so unusual an appearance ¹ ,

¹ We may aleo mention: (1) the declension 11 γόνυ, δόρυ, Hom. 111. δουρί
ε’δορΡ-ἱ, nom. pl. yotvara=*76vf·or·a, att. δόρατα, γόνατα, supra 40 (111;
(2) that 11 κάρᾶ (nent, head), Ion. κάρη, nom. pl. 111111111111. 309),
gen. sing. xpdrts=*rpc-ar-ds 11), ete.
