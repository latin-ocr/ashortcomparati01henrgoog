(145) VIII. Suffioc ·s·.-In Greek the secondary formation
of the aorists in -σ- (ap. ε’-φίλ-η-σ-α, ε’-φύλ-ακ-σ-α, 010.) 10 ex-
tended to all the derived verbs with no other corruptions than
those which will be mentioned in regard to the future. Latin
has lost it, and forms the perfecte 01 110 secondary verbs in
-111 and -υῑ,

(146) ΙΧ. Sufflcc -so-.—Latin has perhaps preserved amid
many corruptions a few traces of the future suffix -00- in the
rare and obscure formatione used as presente, of which in-
0101000 are to be found in capes-se (to try to take), luc-esee (to
try to attach), cf. cap-ie, too-io. In Greek, this suffix, which
’ 10 used to form the future of all derivative verbs, requires the
following observations :-

1. Verbs of which the base is a stem ending in avoiceless
guttural or dental both have the same form in the present
originally ending in -yo‚ eq. φυλάσσω and αἱμάσσω; but in the
case of the former verbs the guttural reappears in the future,
φυλάξω. In imitation 01 this was created the future αἱμάξω,
the 11116 form of Which would be *oipdoo = *αἱμάσσωε *cipum-<rog
in other words, all verbs which have their present in -σσω form
their future in -ξω without distinction.

2. The same assimilation took place, but only in Doric,
between all verbs which had their present 111-ζω(ε-γ-1]ω 01
dyo). Thus the future 01 ὑστερίζω (10 be 1010)10 regularly in
ordmary Greek derepiom=*tiorep-id-uw‚ but in Dorio ὕστερ’ίξω,1
111 imitation of μαστίξω, the regular future 01μαστίζω, 010. This
corruption even extends to primary formatioris, cy. Dor. καθίξᾶς
(having sat).

3. Secondary verbs with a nasal or liquid form their futures
just like primary verbs 01 the same type,2 aq. ἐχθαίρω ἐχθαρῶ,
ἀγγέλλω ἀγγελῶ, ποιμαίνω ποιμανῶ.

4, The IonicAttic formations in ·ε’ω, -ῶ and the Dorio forma-
tions in -σέω, πίω, ι0113 belong te the system of secondary
derivation as much as, or even more than, to that 01 the
primary stems.
