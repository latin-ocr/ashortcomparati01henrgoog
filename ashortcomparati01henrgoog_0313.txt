1n Theocritus (ἀμέλγες, συρίσδες), is evidently due, so far as it
ever hed ony existence ata11,1 to the analogy of the secondary
tenses,2 and is parallel to the Latin forms le9i3=⁸lleqc=a coccea
:monce-c, abcda=*amcd·c‚ audta=*ccdid-s‚ etc.

3. The sign of the 3rd sing. t-ti (Gk. e’o-ri=Sk. eis-ti) occurs ’

in all the uon-thematic forms, but is assibilated after a vowel,

φη-σίι-*φᾱ-τί, τίθη-σι, dido-oe, δείκνῦ-σι; Dor. and Boeot., with· f

out assibilation, τίθη-τι, δίδωτι. Accordingly we should expect,
iu the thematic tenses, Dor. *φέρειτιεὸΙε bbdroti, and Ion.
*φέρεσι; but the Panhellenic forms are φέρει, λύει, which can·
not go back to *φέρετι thien, and must come from the analogy
of 2nd sing. φέρεις, λύεις.3 Similarly in subj. φέρῃ, λύῃ. The

forms which are so common in poetry, ᾄγρσι, λάθῃσι, might =

be regarded as regular (cy. 1φέρῃ-σι--.’1φέρη-τι), if φέρητι were ’

found in Doric, and if rnoreover the ι subscript did not indicate
ut once a new formation based on ἄγῃ with pleonastic addition
of the ending -σι, as in lst sing. ἀγάγωμι based on ἀγάγω.

In Latin, -t, secundary ending: eet (he is), eet (he eats)=
*oo-t, ser-t, volt, det, etot, tt 3-le9it=*le9c⁵-t‚ octaot=*cnictt
=*omoe-t‚ etc..

(250) Π. Duell—No lst person; in 2nd end 3rd‚ ’τον with
no distinction: ἰ’-τον, ride-rev, briocen, etc.

(251) HI. Plorat-1. The regular ending is Lat. -mns, Dor.
-ρες, in ull other dialects -μεν introduced from the secondary
tenses :⁴ ἰ’-μεν, τίθε-μεν,-φέρο-μεν, φέρω-μη Dor. ἰ’-μες, dido-nes,
-hv'o-nes, λύω-μες; Lat. eet-moe, tenus, cla-none, - colanus,
legi-mus, etc.

2. Gk. -τε, Lat. -li815 ἰ’-τε, didere—Mers, ltin-rc3 es-ti8‚
celtis, ferdia—legitis, etc.

3. Originally t-otz· after a vowel, *etto efter a consonant,⁶
whence in Greek -ντι end -αντι, In the thematic conjugation
We find Dor. ἔχο-ντι, dyo-vri, Boeot. καλέο-νθι, ἔχω-νθι, every.
where else with assibilation *φέρι-ναι, *φέρωσι whence Lesb.

⁸ Thus φέρει : φέρεις-ἔφερε t ἔφερες.
