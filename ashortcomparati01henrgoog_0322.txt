consonant, ap. Hom. βεβλή-ατο (οᾰ. vii. 97) analogieal for
ε’·βέβλη-ντο. They are also very common in the Now Ionicos

Herodotus. In the classical language, on the contrary, they
have entirely disappeared; hythe side of ἔθετο; ἔθεντο, ἐλύετο;
ἐλύοντο, etc, this plural in -ατο might well seem an anomaly,
when the original nasal from which the α had arisen was no
longer perceptible. The ending -ντο was introduced wherever
this substitution was possible: ἔ-κει-ντο, ε’-λύσα-ντο, διδοῐντο,
φέροιντο,1 etc. When the group thus obtained would have been
unpronouneeable‚ namely in the pluperfects of roots ending in
aconsonant, eq. ε’-τεταχ-, the language preferred a periphrasis,
τεταγμένοι ἦσαν (they were posted).

(263) The law which derives the primary terminatione from
the secondary by the addition of an i2 would hold good in
Greek for the ist, 2nd‚ and 3rd sing and 8rd plur. mid, if, as
the theory would presuppose,3 the secondary terminatione were
respectively *-μα, ’δ’-σα, *-τα, *-ντο, instead of -μᾶν, -σο, -το, utre.
This is all that osu be said witha view to connecting the two
systems with one another*

*φέρε-σοιτὸδῐ. bledda-sd, indic. ttp=ltear‚ subj. λύῃελύηαι, eto.
In the indicative Attio substitutes λύει, and this form is even
adopted by the κοινὴ in the three verbs βούλει, οἴει and ὄψει.
As it is hardly possible to reconoile λύῃ and λύει, λύει must
probably be regarded as an active form transferred to the

middle‚⁵ especially as the form λύῃ is very common in Old Attio. ’

In the non-thematis presents‚ τίθε-σαι, δίδοται, δείκνυ-σαι, etc.
(but Hom. δίζηαι), the ending -σαι has been restored in its

3rd sing. -τοι comes closer still to the secondary· -το,
