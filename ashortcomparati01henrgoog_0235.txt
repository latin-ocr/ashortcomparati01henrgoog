su, which is reflected in Sk. dece-tu, etc. If then the locative
were *ἵπποι-συ, whence *irrora it would be easily explainable;
but we nowhere find the slightest traco of such a termination,l
and again the Greek form ἵπποισι ἵπποισιν has nothing corre-
sponding to it in any cognate language. , There is however
something corresponding to it in Greek itself in the oblique
case of the dual ἴπποιιν; hence there seems some probability
that Indo-European had a loc. pl. *ekwopsu end aloc. dual
*elcwoysalmt that these two forms were preserved in Greek as
regards their function, but confused in respect of their form,
and that lastly the intervocalio o, regularly dropped in ἵπποιιν,
reappeared in ἵπποισιν through the analogy of the very numerous
forms of the 3rd declension (ποσσίν, τείχεσσιν, etc), in which it
was not intervocalic and therefore necessarily remained. But
this is evidently merely a rudimentary attempt at explanation.
One point in it however must almost certainly be maintained,
namely, that the final ν of this form is not paregogic, but
forms an integral partos the terminati0n;2 ἵπποισιν must be
original, whereas ἵπποισι has been curtailed on the analogy of
other forms in which the awas really paragogic‚ aq. perhaps
*ἵπποφι and *ἵπποφικ

This locative has scarcely survived except in the language
of poetry and in the prose of Herodotus, and moreover has
been entirely confused with the dative3 not only is the one
case used for the other, but they are made to agree together,
just as if they were one and the same case. We know how
common are such phrases as πολλοῖσιν ἀνθρώποις and πολλοῖς
ἀνθρώποισι. In classieal prose, as in Latin, the lost locative
plural is replaced by the dative-ablativo.

6. Geaitice(1).-The original termination of the gen. pl,
which must have been *aaa was kept only in this declension,
where, by contractiori with the thematic o-, it produced o, eg.
*ekacom=*ekw6-6m, Gk. ἵππον, Lat. deum ³= *deam In Greek
this genitive is the only one in use. In Latin it is archaio;

¹ Except perhaps in the adverb μεταξύ, which would thus be locutive plural
of a stem ’μετακ- of the 3rd declension.

² This is proved hy the lact that thie ν never appears except in the plural:
