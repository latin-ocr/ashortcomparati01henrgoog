capricious variatione of the temporal reduplication, we can
barely glean a few instances here and there ol perfecte without
reduplication. It is Herodotus who supplies the most exemplos:
οἶκα for ἔοικα, ἔργασται, etc.

In Latin the opposite process took place. Latin, like Greek,
had inherited from the beginninga few non-reduplicated per·
iects3 in another type, eg. aedi, the reduplication remained,
but was no longer perceptible, and we have seen that this type
was extended by analogy3 lastly, in the whole of a very
important class of socalled perfecte the reduplication was
regularly absent, namely in the old sigmatic aorists which
became entirely confused with the periect;1 hence there was
abundant reason why this element should tend everywhere to
fall into disuse. Accordingly the perfecte mentioned above
are almost the only reduplicated perfecte in Latin. In all the
perfecte in at, ct, and the great bulk of radical perfecte, there
is no reduplication, trev-t, lc-v-t, sec-t, otc-t, tol-r (for ic-tal-i);
much more is this the case with all the false perfecte iu -st,
which never had it, caeci, fibert, pcamt (cf. pepigi, both from
paroye). Further, in Latin as in Greek, the perieots which
have reduplication keep it in all moods: pre-pendere, pc-
pettder-i-m, like lte-hoco, λε-λύκ-οι-μι.

ξ 3. Position of Reduplicctiou.

‹ (242) The position of the reduplication is essentially ,the
same as that of the augment, περιγέγονε, but δεδυστύχηκα, and the
same irregularities are also noticeable, though much rerer:2
false initial reduplication in ἠμφίεσμαι; false medial reduplica-
tion in ὃδοιπεπορήκαμεν, for ὡδοιπορήκαμεν (we have journeyed);
double reduplication in δεδιῄτημαι, ὡδοπεποιημένη. In Latin,
there remains onlya truce of reduplication occurring between
the particle and the verb, in the forms rettulit=*re-tetcclit
mmmdcc-pepon ; as a general rule, even when the simple
verb is reduplicated, the compounds lose the reduplication
(int-pendi, cort-tipo).
