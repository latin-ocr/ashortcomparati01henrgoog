portant secondary suffix belonging to this gronp is that of the
comparative in tero-3 in Greek, nearly all the secondary com-
parativae have -oeepo, just ae nearly all the primary comparativae
end in -ίων,

When the primary stem is an ostem, its vowel is always o,
aovdrdrepffi but when the preceding syllable is short by
nature and by position, this vowel is lengthened to ω, σοφόν
τερινς.1 This phenomenon, which is still partly unexplained‚
is due, either to the Greek rhythmica] law which forbids too
many short vowels to follow one another, or perhaps rather
to the analogy oi the comparatives of adverbs (old ablativos),²
ἇν-ω-τέρω, aar-arripui, σοφ-ω-τέρω(ς), from which the lengthening
may have wrongly passed into the corresponding adjectives.

When the primary stem is one in -εσ-, ymb-conpos, a termi-
nation -e'orepo js produced, which hasbeen wrongly introduced
into other formatione, especially into adjectives in -ov·, ci·-
boipov-e'orepoe. On the other hand, the comparative of the
adverb πάλαι, παλαί-τερο-ς, being wrongly referred to παλαιός

. (old), has given rise to aformation in -ai'repo, which, though

at first restricted to adjectives in -αιο-, γεραίτερος (Hom),
σχολαίτερος, has gradually spread outside these limite, μεσαίτερος,
φιλαίτερος. Lastly, the secondary suffix -aeepo seems to be
added to the primary suffix -ισ· of the comparative in for-
mations like &praerato-s (leit),3 which become much commoner
in post-classica] Greek, eg. κλεπτίστερος (more thievish).

To the last type belong some Latin words with the secondary
suffix tero- whieh have lost their comparative meaning:
moy-ieter (“ the greater of two,’' master), mia-ieter (“ the less
of two,'' servant), sia-is-ter (left, root unknown, hardly the
same as that of Gk. σίν-ο-μαι, to injure). Much more prolific
is the suffix -ter which goes to form adverbs, which are really
comparatives (no doubt nectens, we know that the Greeks said

¹ The form στενότερος (narrower) is only an apparent exception, tor we
must restore 'orevfio'repor (AEol. στέννος, Ion. στεινός).

² See infra 187, 4.

³ Originally no doubt ‘'the better side‚” by a euphemiam like εὐώνυμος.
When the comparative meaning ceased to be felt in this word, it iras
ac‹·ented lihe the adjectives in -ρ5·.
