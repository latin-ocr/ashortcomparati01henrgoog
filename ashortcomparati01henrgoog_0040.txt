GENERAL INTRODUOTION.

(1) Ten grammar of every language, taken by itself, seems
like a purely empirical collectiones arbitrary rules, subject
to still more arbitrary except-iens, which it confines itself to
stating, without being able to afford us even an inkling of their
explanation. Thus French grammar teaches us that the plural
of substantives is formed by adding an s to the singular.
Whence comes this s? and how is it that it has the property
of changing a singular into a plural? To this question French
grammar can give no answer. It teaches that adverbs are
derived from adjectives by adding to the feminine the termina-

exceptione, changing the termination before uacat into em, eg.
pendeat, prademmeat. What is the meaning of this syllable
meat? why does it require the feminine of long, but not of
pranderat? On this point French grammar by itself cannot
enlighten us.

But if we go back to Latin, we see there an accusative
singular cabellum and an accusative plural caballos, which
throw light on the origin of the s in the plural les chorais.
We see there a word melate, ablative of a feminine noun, which,
in such an expression as ldapd mente (literally “ina long
manner ’')‚ required the feminine of the adjective leupus, which
had different forms for masculine and feminine, but could
naturally cause no variation in the adjective prudeus, which
had the same form for masculine and feminine. Thus the
