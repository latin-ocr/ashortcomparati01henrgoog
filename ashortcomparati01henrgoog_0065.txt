of every old pronunciation a, which was perhaps that of the
Homerie age, and certainly that of several dialeets‚ as is
proved by the dialectieal representation of this vowel by ους
ep. Boeotian οΰμές (γοωεῦμεῖς, Laconian μουσίδδει1 (he speaks)
:rpeorla It is by a also that Latin represents the υ of its
oldest Greek loen-words, which were horrowed from the Doric
dialeots of Magna Graecia; aq. fiteas=ptaoa perpetra:
πορφύρᾰ. But later, in the Augustan age, when it horrowed
words from the κοινή, it also introduced into its alphabeta
new symbol, y, meant to represent υ, which shows that the
Latin alphabet possessed no letter that could serve to repre·
sent exaetly the Greek vowel as pronouneed at that period.
Now the sound which was then non-existent in Latin was c.
Hence we must infer that the old u had in the classica] period
become il, and so the correct pronunciation of υ is that of
French rt. From this intermediate stage it passed to ito
present pronunciation of i.

It is possible that Greek had some nesalized vowels² and
some dialeets certainly possessed them3 but as they are not
distinguished in writing‚ it is impossible to determineprecisely
their pronunciation.

(24) 2. Diphthooqs.-Greek writing represents every large
number of real or apparent diphthongs. By far the most
important are those in which the vowel comes first,2 among
which we may distinguish the series with the semi-vowel ι and
chat with the semi-vowel υ.

A.-Series αι, ει, οι- dt, ηι, ωι.

αι and οι are in modern Greek simple vowels‚ e and i; but
this pronunciation is late, as is shown by the mere fact
of their transliteration in Latin by ae and oe, which in the
Augustan age still represented real diphthongs‚ ep. in the
horrowed words aether and poena. We shall not be far
wrong then in pronouncing distinctly ay and oy.

ει in modern Greek is also an i; but beneath this unifonnity
of spelling and pronunciation are concealed two quite distinct
sounds: (1) a diphthong ει, which came from Indo-European
ey (telredlc'yqo) or from the Hellenie contraction of e÷r

¹ This pronunciation still remains in Tsaeonian. ² Gt snpra 20, 3.
