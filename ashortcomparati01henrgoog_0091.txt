(ε*πένθ-σο-μαι, cf. πένθος, grief) ἔπαθον πέπονθα, would be
enough ιο show that δρα is the reduced formos δερ, and to
prove the presence of a latent nasal in the stem of ἔπαθονε

Thus from historioal phoneties we gain a complete confirma-
tiones the principle we have already learned from physiologieal
phonetios‚² namely‚ that the nasale and liquide are consonante
when they rest for support upon a vowel, vowele when a
consonant reete for support upon them.

’ (44) Neither Greek nor Latin possessos nasal or liquid
sonante (vowele). We shall see how they have changed those
of the Indo-European language.

Greek hae three naeal consonante, denoted respectively by
the letters γ,, ν, and μ. Before a guttural explosive (ἄγγελος,
ἄγκυρα, ἄγχι), γ is the regular mode of writing the guttural
naeal (supra 21, 2), which never appears except in thie posi-
tion.3 ν ie the dental nasal‚p the labial nasah and neither of
these sounds presente any difficulty. They are often inter-
changed in writing; ap. ἅνγελος, ἀνφοτάροις, ete.

Latin hae likewiee three nasals: the guttural‚ written n
ι before e guttural, aepulas (εαιιριιῑιιι),4 and ybefore a nasah
clipeus l=dtrtnus), the dentale and the labial m. These two
signs are frequently interchanged in inscriptione. Often eleo
the nasal ie not written (feceret, meses); this is especially the
case with final m in archaie inscriptione: cino, αι’νό (Epit.
