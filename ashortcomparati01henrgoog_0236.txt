but, while it was generally superseded by the genitive in
616161, 11 yet held its own permanently: (1) in the language
of poets; (2) in formulae, especially legal and liturgioal formulae,
going back to remote antiquity, eg. Deum 0666661616 31 (3) in
official language and terme relating to money, decem milia ees·

tertium, not seueritatem, and so also nummum not 6661166- ,

rum, praefectus fabrum (title of a public official), etc.

7. Genitioe (2) (1161161-’1116 gen. pl. of pronouns ended
regularly in -erutm=I.·ltl. *o-eem, eg. istorum, and we have
seen that the pronomina] deelension hada great influence on
the one which we are now dealing with. Again, the gen. pl.
of the 161 declension in -urum likewise goes back to Indo.-
European. Lastly, from the time when final syllables in m
tended to become short, the Latin gen. pl. was no longer dis-
tinguished from the acc. sing. All these causes combined 16
bring about the creation aud extensior of an analogical genitive
in 61661,6611611116,66666661η,6111611 almost entirely superseded
the former one.

52. Neutere. ¹

(190) The dcelension of neuters differs only in two points
from that of the masculinos and femininos.

1. Nominatioe-Vocutioe-Accueative singulae—The nomi-
native neuter is always like the accusative, which has the
ordinary termination en: ζυγά-ν jugurro. The vocative neuter
has everywhere been assimilated to the nominative.

2. Nominatiae-Vocative-Accasative plural-The ending of
this 6666166 16 Vedio Sanskrit, yuqd, but 11 16 Greek and
Latin, ζυγὰ jope. How 16 this difference to be explained?
. Lat 66 suppose that the termination was originally α ; then we
ought to have, in Greek and Latin, not only *ζυγά *ju9u=
1669611 contracted, but also, in the 3rd declension for example,
1616111111. This supposition lacks probability, for we donet

also the known 1666 61 Latin scande, entirely forbid the hypothesis that
deum is 6 syncopated form of deorum.
