which seems to show that the first letter loeee its aspiration,
ae is also preeupposed by the initial aspiratos of ἔξω and θρέψω.
It must however be observed that in the old Attio alphabet, in
which the double consonante had not yet been developed‚ these
groups were always written φσ and χσ, whatever their origin.

(δ) In Greek anon-aspirated explosive, when followed by an
aspirated explosive‚ becomes aspirated: heia-o ε’-λείφθη, στίζω
τ’*στίγῃω {mlx-dp, eto. This assimilation however seems to
have existed merely in writing3 the first exploeive must have
been a simple voicelese consonant.

(ε) Before a nasah a voicelees guttural becoomes voiced: Gk.
wpdooor=*wpdx-y‹o, πρᾶγ-μα, βρέχ-ιο (to moisten), perf. βέ-βρεγ·
μαι; Lat. aec-ore (to cut), seponerem-m, etc.¹

(ζ) These regular alternatione of voiced, voiceless, and aepi-
rated consonante in formatione obviously related to one another
naturally gave riee to analogical confusions, which caused each
sound to spread outeide ite proper sphere. Thus, by the eide of
ὀλλάττωε*ἀλλάκ-ρ[ω, we find the aor. paee. hhhdy-p-vand the sub·
stantive ἀλλαγ-ή, based on the regular ἥλλαγ-μαι; πρᾶγ-μα gave
riee to a perfect πέ-πρᾱγ-α, and the aspirated perfecte of Attio
and tho κοινή (τέ-τρῐφ-α from τρίβ-ω, πέ-πλεχ-α from πλέκ·ω)
are doubtlees due to analogy. We need only‘ compare ἅρπ-αξ
ἄρπ-αγ-ος with the other Greek noune in -αξ, which form their
genitive in -ακ-ος, and with the Latin noune of the same type,
vor-occ octe, to be convinced that in the Greek word the
voioed guttura] cannot be original; on the other hand, corcy-o
(whirlpool), which is connected with corda, seems to point to
aprimitive decleneion *corace *voroppoia the 9 being after· ’
warde introduced by analogy into the nominative. So again
the guttural of pdoc poc-is was softened quite regularly in
pampo (to fix, fasten, of. πήγ-νῦ-μ), which doubtlees arose from
*pac-oo, later *podpoo (infra), and this softening in its turn
was wrongly extended to pe-pip-t. A very slight acquain-
tance with either language will suffice to furnish many other
examplee.

(63) B.-(o) In Greek and Latin, a guttural or labial explo-

1cea1s0 ‹ily-nuc es contrasted with dic-ero or rather dec-et, and see
the further investigation ol thie guttural later on.
