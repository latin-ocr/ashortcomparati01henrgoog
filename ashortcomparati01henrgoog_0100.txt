pronounced lc before all vowels; the assibilation of cbeforei
and e belongs to the Merovingian period. The archaia letter k
was scarcely used except at the beginning of certain words,
especially before a, koleudoe, Kartago. Lastly, q was written
before consonantal u, and sometimes before vocalia u, jecur.
The voiced guttura] was in Old Latin written c, and this
inconvenieut spelling was retained in 0. and Oa, which are
abbreviatione of Gaius and Gnaeus respectively; but in every
other case the sign used was 9, which was pronounced before e
and i in the same way as before a, o, u.

B.-Deutals: t, cl. Τ before i÷vowel (terminatione tie,
dius) was only assibilated at a very late period.

O.-Labiols: p, b, which present no difficulty.
Ι 2. Spiruuta. Besides Ιι Latin had five spirants; namely,
the voiced palatal j, already studied as a semi-vowe13 the voice·
less dental s, of Indo-European origin3 the voiceddental, result-
ing from the soitening of this, also written s (z generally only
in words borrowcd from Greek); the voicelesslabial f, arising
from the Indo-European aspirated explosivcs3 and the voiced
labial u, already studied as a semi-vowel.

THE ORIGINAL EXPLOSIVES AND THEIR DEVELOPMENT.

(56) Indo-European probably had as many as sixteen ex·
plosiwes‚ inasmuch' as each of the four classes (velare, palatals,
dentale, labials) included four consonants3 namely, one voice*
less, one voiceless aspirata, one voiced, and one voiced aspirato.
From these sixteen explosives arose, on the one hand, the
nine Greek explosives, on the other, the six Latin explosives,
together with h and s.

§L Velare.
Qssy) 1.-E.o,qa‚9ga. It is mainly Sanskrit which has ren-
dered it possible to clearly distinguish the primitive velers from
the palatals.l In certain European languages, including Greek

ξ Eg. LE. q becomes in slat or c, whereas I.-[l.k is changed to the
spirant c.
