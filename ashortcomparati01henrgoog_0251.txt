eg. Gk. φρήν (ppei-do) τέρην, ἄφρων, κύων (voe. κύον), ποιμήν7
ἄκμων (dapar-or), eta, Lat. lien (gen. lieu-io). Latin, in its
-en-stems, which however are very rare, has generally lost
the lengthening, eg. pecten instead oi *pecten through the
analogy, either of the oblique cases (gen. *pecten-io, later
pretio-io) or of the nominative termination of the neuters
(uomendyuemqo). In the -on-stems it not only reproduoes
the lengthening‚ but also drops the final u of the stem, eg.
bomo (bomin-ie), oripo, hirundo, consuetude, eto.; this seems
to represent a still more primitive formos the Indo-European
nominative.¹ In many cases the lengthening does not seem to
be oonfined exclusively to the nominative; but in these cases,
either the stem already had a long vowel, whioh did not admit
of a fresh lengthening (ay. perhaps αἰῶν- stol), or the long
vowel oi the nominative was improperly extended to the oblique
cases, as will be seen later on:3 Gk. λειχήν λειχῆν-ος, Ἕλλην
Ἕλλην-ος, χειμών χειμῶν-ος; Lat. lien lieo-ie, sermo sermon-is,
edo edon-is, latro latren-ie, eto.

Notioe also the lengthening in two m-stems, xddv=*yddp,
χιώνε*χιώμ (but Lat. biom-s, and Gk. defleta-3), and in the
comparatives‚ the stem of which ends in a nasal only in Greek,
not in Latin, μείζων μείζονος.

4. Liquid stema—Lengthening is almost invariable; but it
disappears in Latin, owing to the shortening of every final
syllable ending in r: πατήρ (aoo. πατέρ-α), Ραίονε*ροίέν; δοτήρ,
with long vowel extended to the oblique oases (δοτῆρ-ος); so
also in φώρ and fr'tr; δώτωρ (gen. δώτορ-ος); recondantur,
soror=*soror·‚ where the original long vowel is shown by its
having passed into the oblique oases.

5. -s-stems.-All stems of this alass show the long vowel in
the nominative, namely :—(o) the masculinos and femininae in
·08·, ·es·, Gk. αἰδώς (αἰδόοςε*αῑδόσ-ος), ἀναιδής, εὐγενής, etc„

Α Lat. boreos and laoo6r=*bouor‚ arbos and arbitrantur (gen.

arbor-is, bonor-is), caedes (of. the infin. cerdera* deponar:

¹ The true nominative in Greek would therefore be *ᾱκμω *rotavi and so
also *narrt *pota *toral *odra 'dota ete ‚ (oi. sk. pita, dard). 'Phe u and r
