ἓ 3. The personat provacans in syntectical juatcpoeitioo.

(228) In Greek and Latin all the forms of the personal pro·
nouas are capable of being strengthened hythe addition oia
pronoun denoting identity. In Latin the juxtaposition remains
syntactioal throughout, αμα ipse, tat ipsius, semetipsum, and
each word retains its own deolension. The same holds good as
a rule in Greek: ἐγὼ αὐτός, σοὶ αὐτῷ, ἡμῖν αὐτοῖς, ὑμῶν αὐτῶν, σφᾶς
αὐτούς, eto.; in certain cases, however, the first word has be·
come indeclinable. The regular acc. ἔμ’ αὐτόνεέμὲ αὐτόν, being
written as one word ἐμαυτόν, produced the apparently corre-
sponding forms ἔμουτῷ ἐμαυτοῦἕ and the semeis the case with
σεαυτῷ σαυτοῦ, ἑαυτοῦ αὖτῷ; then in the plural, the stem *of-
belonging originally to all three numbers, ἑαυτούς αὑτούς, ἑαυτοῖς
αὐτοῖς, ἑαυτῶν αὐτῶν. Polybius even uses ἑαυτῶν es a reflexive
pronoun for all three persons.3

In the Ionic of Herodotus an exactly parallel analogy seems
to have started from the gen. sing. ἐμέο αὐτοῦ eontracted to
, ἐμεωυτοῦ, whence ἐμεωυτόν, and similarly σεωυτῷ, ε’ωυτοῖς, etc.
