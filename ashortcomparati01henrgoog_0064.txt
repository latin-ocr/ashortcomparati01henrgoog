ἓ 1. Greek.

(23) 1. Vowele-Greek possessos five short vowels, α, ε, ι,
ο, υ, and e corresponding number of long vowels, ᾰ, η, ῐ, o, ῦ.
To these must be added, as will be seen later on, the two
false diphthongs ει and ου.

The pronunciatron of a and ι, long or short, presenis no diffi-
oulty3 rand ο were olose ἔ end 63 ω probably a very open o,
There isne controversy except as to η and υ.

The η of modern Greek is an i, but there is no doubt that
this pronunciation does not represent that of the ancients.
The fact that η was always regarded as the long vowel eorre-
sponding to ε, the Latin transliteration of η by e,¹ the syllable
βῆ, which in a verse of the eomedian Cratinus represents the
bleating of sheep, and other arguments besides, justify us in
asserting that, at any rate up to the classieal period, η was
equivalent io amore or less open e. It is possible however
that in popular pronunciation itacism crept in pret-ty early;
but it does not appear to have finally prevailed until the
beginning of the Byzantine period.

The same is the ease with v, whioh is likewise an i in
modern Greek. We shall see that υ is the regular represen-
tative of Indo-European' u3 this is a presumption in favour

¹ 'l'he transliteration by i belongs to the periodos the spread of Chris-
tianity‚ of which popular Greek was essentially the medium.
