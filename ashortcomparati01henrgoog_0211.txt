governed by the second: Gk. ἀνδράδελφος (husband’s brother),
ἀνδρείκελος (man-like), νοτοφόρος (carrying on the back), ποδωκής
(swift-footed), equivalent respectively to ἀνδρὸς ἀδελφός, ἀνδρὶ
εἴκελος, νώτῳ φοράς, πόδας ὠκύς, etc.; Lat. idcif8r=llicem fere'ns,
pedi-ecqaoe=pcde sequens, ociaificae, oaaiicolae, ignivomae,

(γ) compounds in which the first term is an indeclioablc
