(rerum), and from thence to lingual r31 in fact, the only
difference between the two consiste in the quivering of the ,
tangue, already described.

The loss in Greek and rhotacism ln Latin of inter·
vocalic aforms one oi the most constant laws established
by phonetics. From the multitude of examples it may bc a

enough to mention: uk. subj. (Hom.) έοε*έσ·ω (Ι may be), Att.
ὧ, Lat. fut. μῦθος-ῦς Gk. *γέν-εσ-ος (gen. of γέν-ος, cf. sk.
jehesus), whence γένεος and γένους, Lat. perterta=*peude-te;
Gk. αἰδώς, gen. aiboir=uiddos=*uid·6rr-or‚ Lat. arbos, gen.
arbott8=*arb·68·ds; Gk. gen. pl. χωράων χωρῶνε*χωρᾶ·σων,
Lat. terret-ruam Gk. μῦς μοός, Lat. mur-i83 Gk. nom. pl. neut.
μείζωε*μείζοαε*μείζ-οσ-α, Lat. mdjdra=*mdh-j68·a,² etc. In ,
Latin, analogy generally introduced the r into the termination
of the nominative: cf. the doublets honus and honor, arboe and
arbor, the abstract noune in -ὄν, ἀοῖον, labor, etc, and the com-
paratives muj6r=*acuy'ca; but the 8 remains in the nom-acc.

Hence we might expect never to find, either in Greek or
Latin, an e between two vowels. There are however many
cases of this in both languages, but they never arise frema
primitive intervocalic e. Phenetically, they may usually be
traced to a regular reduction of the historica] group aa, adeor:
μέσσος, cuusa=cuuseu,⁸ or to Greek τ assibilated before ι, φύσις
:idum in other cases their originis simply analogical. Thus
the intervocalic σ of βουσίν, ναυσίν, ἵπποισιν (cf. the oblique case
of the duel ἵπποιιν) seems to have been restored on the mode'l
of ποσσίν, φλεψίν, θριξίν, where the σ, not being intervocalic, re·
mained; so also wehave λύσω έλῐνσο (instead of *hue *έλῦα) and
all similar futures and aorists, because of λείψω έστιξσ audather
forms, where the σ was regularly kept. The remaining instances
of intervocalic a which cannot be traced either to this phonetic
origin or to analogy are quite insignificant. Scarcely any can

ever the change has been in the opposite direction. [cf. also Eng. blera with
