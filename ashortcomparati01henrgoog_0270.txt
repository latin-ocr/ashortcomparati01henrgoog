H. Musculines aud femininos in -es-.-In Greek, lengthen-
ing of the nominative: ψευδής *aroldo-a (ψευδέα ψευδῆ), etc. So
also in Latin, Ocres Gerar-is, but with rhotacism extended to
the nominative and consequent shortening, celer, degener}
Originally this class included in Latin a larger number of stems
than have been preserved: by comparing, for example, orthea
with Gk. νέφος and sk. nathae (gen. eabbae-ua), aedes with
ἕδος, nuclea with moles-tus (cf. hones-tua), etc.,² itis easy to see
that the regular declension was nubes *nubes-ie. The dat-abl.
pl. *nubcsbus became nubibus, whence through analogy a dat.
sing. now and all the rest of the declension, as though based
on a stem *uubi-. The result is that, except in the nom. sing, x
the declension of nubea no longer differs from that of ovis.

ΙΠ. Neuters in -os· (·es-).—The gradation in these stems
is well known: the o appears only in the nom-acc. sing, τεῖχος
*τείχεσ-ος (τείχεος τείχους), funus *felnes-is (funeris), etc· In
Latin, however, several stems have generalized the o ,· *tempor
*tempos-is, *corpus *corpus-is, which became phonetically
tempus temporie, etc.

IV. Neuters in asa—This declension, which is confined to
Greek, shows no gradation, but is based on two stems, one in
-ἄσ·, the other in -ἄτ·; κέρας ripae-os, and also *ue'puo-os (κέραος
κέρως), *ripun-u (¹¹'xe'puu κέρᾰ), otest

V. Greek perfect participatae-The sigmatio form of the
suffix (*-fon·) appears only in the nom. sing. (λελῡκώς hellade)
and in the formation of the feminine (λελυκυῐαε*λελυκύσ-ια).
ΑΗ the rest of the declension> is based on adental stem, with

¹ Perhaps also shortening without rhotacism in the form einis: *cinea (lor
circes l), on the model ol the oblique cases (⁸eiu5s-ie changed to cineris).

‘² In spite ol the differcnee ol quantity m the radica] vowel, which may,
in all these cases, depend on every ancient modification of the root. cf.
cupra 124, 2.

, 3Τὴυεπῡὸῑιπιῐὸὶὸαε-τουῑεουίὺιικ. On the other hand it was probably

the regular gen. *lacteum which gave riso to the archaia gen. bonerum cited

bystdzdyrriu lae-The dative (locutive) sing. κέρᾳ still remains to be accounted

for; t being subscript only after a long vowel, we ought to have κέραι. The

form κέρᾳ must be regarded as a mere variation of spelling, unless (which is

highly improbable) it is a true dative (*ripoir=*xipu·ur).—The Hom. nom.

Ι pl. γὲρᾶ (ΙΙ. ii. 237), κρέᾶ (ΙΙ. viii. 231), go back to ye'poi, κρέα, the final u being
shortened in imitation ol the other neuter plurale.
