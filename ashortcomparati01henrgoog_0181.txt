(140) Most of the primary suffixos are also secondary, and
these will not be repeated in this new enumeration except in
so far as they have very important formatione depending on
them. Muoh less can the suffixes which are purely secondary
find a place in a short sketch like the present; only the
commonent can here be dealt with, and for the rest the student
must be referred to the special treatises on Greek or Latin

derivatico.

§L Oommoo Formationa

Ι. Scffloc ·n1'r·‚ ·nu·.-This suffix has spread only in Greek,
where it appears secondarily under the form -uaa'r, -ννυ-, ay.
κρεμά-ννῦ-μι (to hang), κορέ-ννῦ-μι (to satiate), perhaps on the

analogy of the regular donbling in σβέννῦμι, ἔννῦμι.1 But »

some of these formatione seem primary, aq. σκεδάψνῦ-μι (to
scallor), πετάψνῠ-μι (to spread), etc„ compared with σκίδ-νη-μι,
πίτ-νη-μι (same meanings).

(141) II. Snfflcc ·yo-.-The derivative suffix -yc, by far the
most important of the secondary suffixos of the present tense,is
added in Greek and Latin to all kinds of nominal stema, which
it is convenient to distinguish and classify as follows:

1. Stems ending in e(o), tt-Types: φιλ-έ-ωε*φιλ-ἔ-ῃω from
φίλ-ε- (ode-os), flac-eo from flac-os (yellow); ζυγ-ό-ιο (to yoke)
