eruco-narra vocenrsu. 43

mortem Gk. rtpdu=*rtp‹i·ye, and Lat. amc=⁴⁸omco (cf. τιμῶ)ε
*omo-yffi and so all the contracted verbs; -yo- efter a vowel, a
formative suffix of adjectivae, Gk. praesagere-yae, Lat
aurew·3=*ause-yo-8, cf. Sk. hiraayd-yoo (golden), etc. When
the first vowel is a nasal cr liquid, we shall see that the
treatment is different.

We find however in Greek a number of cases of intervocalic
ι, but in these cases the ι was not originally intervocalic, but
became so in Greek itself through the loss of a primitive con·
sonent (ep. καίω, Ι burn=*xar'fo, iufra), or else was restored
by analogy in forms from which it must have previously dis-
appeared. Thus in τιθείην, διδοίην, instead of which we should
expect *διδόηη etc, the diphthong is probably due to the
analogy of διδοῖμεν, eto, where the ι could not be dropped.

In Latin intervocalic j no longer appears except as the relic
of a group of consonante which have ooalesced. Eg. major:
*moy-yos·,¹ cf. mog-uua and μακ-ρό·ς; end meio (I make water)
=*meit-yo, cf. Gk. d-pix-e'o and sk. mih miph (same meaning),
etc. '
Later Greek, and especially Attio, even partially elimineted
ι, when it had become intervocalic through the loss of a oon-
scnent: Homeric Gk. τοῖο (of the), changed to *rou then
contracted (Lesb, Dor.) τῶ, (Ion-Att) τοῦ; Hom. Gk. πλείω,
Now Ion. τελέω, Att. τελῶ, eto.2 This last process however is
much less constant; hence the termination of verbs in -είωε
-έω, and the well known adjectival terminations in -οιο-, uro,
-ειο-, which depend ou phonetic laws not yet satisfactorily
determined.

O.-Betweeo a coosouont ond vowel proethnic y is changed
to the vowel iin Latin; inGreek it is combined in various
ways with the preceding consonant.

(a) Il the preceding consonant is a spirant, nasal, or r, the
y, palatalizes the consonant (supra 22, 3 Β) and gives riso to
a compensatory lengthening ol the preceding syllable: LE.
*tdsyo (gen. of the demonstrative ryg, of. Sk. tri-syo), Gk.

¹ Or better still ‘met-ior· 3 cl. Sk. mot-tyto (greater).
2 So aleo the verb ποιέω must olten be read ποέω in the tragediam, as is
shown by the scansion (cf. the Latin horrowed word poeto).
