52. Latin.

(73) The laws of Latin contraction are much harder to
understand than those of Greeh3 for in Latin we hardly ever
find the form with hiatus side by side with the contracted
form. We must confine our attention to those cases which are
most certain and most interesting..

1. a, tte-The difference of vowel between gen. acris=*dtris

(cl. uenus and sk. gen. dyneus) and 2nd pl. amaricatione-tis
(cf. Gk. rintre=rtpdere), can only arise from a difference ol
quantity in the a; we are therefore justified in laying down
cherule: a÷c=ae3 o÷c=a It is a group a÷c⁶ which has
given oc in the gen-dat. sing. terrac; but the quantity of
both vowels is unknown. There is indeed the archaic terrai,
but there is no proof that terrae is derived from this form.
If the vowel of the verbs in *ao was really a, we must
restore amomus=*cma-o-mus, canonistarum-out, and amo:
ioman, and thence lay down the rule that a÷ ὄ :ct and o÷ ῦ =⁰3
but it is possible that the a was not long throughout the whole .
conjugation. It is also possible that the group a÷o always
became ὁ, and that amamus, amant were simply modelled on
the vocalism of amos, amotis, as monemus, raonem, which
can only come from *moeremus and *moncont were certainly
modelled on mones, monetis.
· 2. e, e.—ea, eo are not eontracted; ca becomes ἑ, depo:
*de-tipo, ‹tetenstete-Mirati, of. also praebendae-tobei). ἔέ,
, et, ec, e'e become e, eg. monetc=*monc·t-te, cf. φιλέετε, aves
(nom. pl.)=*uot‹?s‚ cf. πόλεες πόλεις, dorestate-em, perf. degi, =
*de-ege, eto. The groups eet, e÷o are never contracted except
in synizesas like alveo dissyllabic, which ere found in poetry‚
and no doubt occurred also in popular Latin. The group eu
from co also remains uncontracted‚ aurete, though here also
synizesis' is possible under the same conditione, eg. alveus
' dissyllabic. But when the u is primitive, a÷o gives cu,
neuter, and ἔ ÷ot gives at, nultus=*ne-altas.
