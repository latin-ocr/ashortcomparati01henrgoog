Besides these changes, two peculiarities 01 the Greek language
must also be noticed. ¹The firstis the frequent lengthening
01 the initial vowel of the 111110111,ποδ-ήνεμο-ς,3 ἄν-ήνεμο-ς,
3110111μο1, τρι-ώβολο-ν, 010. This lengthening, justified in the
· above exemplos by a 1100011101 01 short syllables, hasbeen
extended by analogy to a number 01 other cases where this
explanation does not hold good: ‹iv-(erosos (incurable), ἀν· ¹
ήκουστος (unheard 01),ἐ1ήνωρ(111110), ἀμφήκης (twoedged),
αῑγ-ῶνυξ, etc. The other phenomenon, which is equally common,
is the vowel-gradaticn already mentioned, which causes the
final syllable of the last term to pass, either (1) from the
, reduced to the deflected grade, ay. atpa=atanp and ὁμ-αίμων
(01 the same blood), κτῆμα (possession) and εὒ-κτήμων (rich), or
(2)*1101111116 normal bo the deflecbed grado, φρήν ἅ·φρων ἔχε’-φρων,
πατήρ ἄ-πάτωρ πατροπάτωρ (paternal grandfather), μήτηρ δυσ-μήτωρ
(01 1 bad mother), but δυσ-μήτηρ subst. (bad mother), and the
phrase μήτηρ ἀμήτωρ (unnatural mother), 01 (3) conversely from
the deflected to the normal grade, αἰδώς ᾰν-αιδής, γένος ὠγενής,
κράτος Σω-κράτης, 010.4 The only example in Latin correspond-
ing to the last case ispanus cte-peace.

¹ The vowel t, which is etymologicslly obscure, has the same meaning ss

⁸Gf. the same lengthening in ήνεμόεις (windy), ἀθάνατος (probably pro·
10110011ᾰτθάνατος),11(1011101 cases where otherwise three short syllables
would follow one another.

⁴ But there is no need to bring under the head 01 gradation the type
κέρας alat-nepos (with 1011110111), in which, ss in the genitive κέρως,
tepor 11 merely a substitute 101 -κέρατος, 01. the poetic doublet εῠ-κέραο-ς,
and supro 129. The accentuation‚ which seems to go against this etymology,
is probably due to the analogy 01 that 01 1011111110 cll-yses (fertile)=
