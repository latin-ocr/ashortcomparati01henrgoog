(243) The person· or conjugation-endings correspond
to three categorias in the system of verbal inflexion: person,
number, and voice. The first two have already been defined.¹
Voice denotas the relation of the verbal concept to the
subject; it is called active or middle (mediopassive)‚
according as the action is thought of as taking place in regard
to others or in regard to the subject himself. Indo-European
had, in both voices, person-endings corresponding to the three
numbers, and to the three persons ol each number. Greek has
kept both voices; it has also added to them some exclusively
passive forms, some of which (the futures) are conjugated like
the middle, others (the aorists) like the active.2 It has likewise
kept all three numbers; but the lst person dual has disappeared,
and the other two persons are lost in some dialects, and may
in all be replaced by those oi the plural without making any
diilerence.3 Latin has lost all traca of the dual, at least as
regards its grammatical iunction. It has two voices; but its
mediopassive, which is peculiar to Latin and contains nothing,
or next to nothing, of a primitive character, cannot be compared
with that of Greek, and will require separate consideration.

IndeEuropean distinguished, in each voice, four classes of
person-endings3 those of the tenses called secondary (aug-
