A.-The most remarkable instance of this kind of reduction t

is furnished in Latin by the group tet, which must have been
developed, before Greek and Latin yet existed, from the meeting
of a dental explosive with a t. Por from fuid-a we should have
regularly had and sing. *feld-do, 2nd pl. *ἠδ-τέ, and Greek has

Greek taken by itself.² But in Latin the phenomenon is much χ
