A. The thematic termination cannot be determined‚ when
considered solely by itself; it consisted ofa single vowel,
which had been contracted in the pro-ethnic period with the

final o of the verbal stem3 the analogy oi the perfect however¹
is a ground for believing that this vowel was a, eg. Gk. φέρω,
Lat. sier-o =*bhdr·o =*bber-o·a, and in the subj. φέρ-ωτ-*ὂὴένθα
(cs. lst pl. depompatae-oeae The only thematic tenses
in Latin being the present indicative, the future of the letand
2nd conjugatione, and the future perfect, it is only in these
that the ending -σ is met with3 but in Greek it characterizes
all futures and subjunctives. It has however been to some
extent contaminated by the influencc of the non-thematic ter-
mination -μι; AEolic in particular conjugates in -μι a good many
verbs which in the common language are verbs in -ω, κοίλη-μι,3
‹bilin-yar, ἑπαίνη-μ, γέλαι-μι; so also Boeotian‚ φίλει-μι, coiea-pq
and to the same corruption must be ascribed the ending -ωμι
in the lst sing. of the subjunctive, which is not uncommon in
Homer, ἐθέλωμι, ἴδωμι, ἀγάγωμι, 91οέ

¹ B. The non-thematic termination lt-nei is kept unchanged
in Greek? εἰ-μί (Lesb. ἔμ-μι, Dor. ἠ-μί) = *ἔα-μί, εἶ-μι, τίθη-μι,
δείκνῑνμι, etc, It may have been superseded here and there by
the termination -ω, in consequence of the transition, already
mentioned, ofa verbal form from the one conjugation to the
other; ⁵ thus σβεννύεις (Pindar ⁶) points to a lst sing. *σβεννύω;
but this phenomenon is rare and rather late. In Latin it is
general and very ancient3 it is only necessary to compare fer-c
with fert ccl-o with voli, teo withi-t,t etc. The non-t tthema' tic
termination (of course sebondary) survives only in the form
sam, and evanthis form rs corrupted⁷
