χώρᾰ, Ion. σοφίη, ἡμέρη, χώρη,1 Lat. terra, etc· As far es we
can go back into the Indo-European period, these nominativos
appear without any visible termination, which however need
not surprise us, for thie ie not an isolated case; many similar
instances will be found in the imparisyllabic declension. But
a more serioue difficulty ie the regular contraet between the
long vowel in Greek end the short in Latin. The identity
of the two vowels is indisputeble ; for ante-classica] Latin had
the long vowel, as ie proved by many scansione Ἴ in Saturnian
verses anderen in Ennius32 but how can thie final vowel,
originally long, have become first common, and then short?
Various explanatione have been offered, hut all insufficient.
(1) A purely phonetic shortening: but this hypothesis is in
contradiction to all we know of Latin phonology, (2) (lon-
fusion with the vocative, which must have had the short
vowel: but, if the prehistorio vocative had been *terret it
would probably have become Lat. *terres (3) A phonetic
shortening, originating in iamhic werde, fcipd=dvyrj, benef
and thence extended to the termination of other words: this
hypothesis is the least untenable, though it essigns a quite
disproportionate influence to the lew of iambio words Per·

' haps it would be better to etart from the aco. sing. *terrens

which would be changed to terrc'm in accordance with the law
regulating final syllables in m, and from thie the short vowel
might very easily bave crept into the nominative.

2. Vocelive .· the simple stem without any termination, and
hence like the nominative in Greek and Latin. Homeric
Greek' however shows traces of an old vocative in ἅ, whether
primitive cr not we cannot say, νύμφᾶ, κοῦρὸι.ὖ

3. Accusative: -m, presenting no difficulty, Gk. reptile-v:
νεφέλᾶ-ν, ἡμέρᾱ-νεὴμέρη-ν, Lat. terrd·m=*terrd·m.
