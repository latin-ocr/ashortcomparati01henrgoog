'and cognomen-tremam many others, also the forms armenta-or
- (ploughing animal), jez-ruentum (beast of burden, from *jug to
yoke, or juvare, to help), incre-meatum (increase), etc. In
Greek thissecondary suffix appears even in the declension of the
primary stems in ·μα; soritis clear that σώ-μα-τα would bs more
properly the nom. pl. of a word *od-pa-rov=*cd-pp·ro·, than of
σῶ-μα. From the plural, favoured perhaps by other accessory

circumstances,1 this τ passed by analogy into the singulam ’

hence the great difference between the oblique cases in Greek
and Latin, ag. dat. rodonia-t and dvdpar-r.

5. An important class oi Greek words, however, remained
uncontaminated, and may be direetly compared with the Latin
neuters, namely the AEolio and Dorio infinitives in -μεν-αι and
-μεν, ey. ἔμμεναι (to be)=*io·yatv-or, and ἔμμεν, δό-μεν-αι (to give),
n-dr‘rprv-ar (to put), στᾶμεν (to stand), etc. That from a mor-
phological point of view the infinitiva, like the participle, is the
caseform of a noun, is evident from the mere consideration of
its meaning and its use in the sentence. Hence, if, as is possible,
-αι is a dative termination lost in the rest of the Greek system
oi declension, and if on the other hand the bare stem δό-μεν is
to be compared with certain locatives found in the oldest lan·
guege of -India, and which have been called locatives without a

suffix,² it will be seen that δό-μεν-αι and δό-μεν are respectively · .
