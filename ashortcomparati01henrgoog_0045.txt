(9) B.-The Ionic group, which is by far the most im-
portant from a literary point of view, has only a few varieties. '

(a) First comes the Old Ionicos Asia Minor (Smyrna,
chios, eto), the oldest Greek known, which forms the basis.
oi the language of the Homeric poems (at any rate of such as
have come down to ue), and of the epio poems of all his later
imitatore.

(b) The New Ionic oi Asia Minor, as known to us from
the writings of Herodotus and Hippocrates² seems to differ
from the preceding dialect only in a' few trifling points; but
inscriptions prove the existence of more deoided differences

(e) The Ionio of the islands (Cyclades, Euboea) seems to be
the connecting link between the dialects oi Asia andEurope. ¹

(ct) The Ionic of Athens, or Attio, differe from ordinary Ι
Ionio only in one essentia] point: it keeps or restores primitive
dasteri er ρ. Rq. Dor. ἴστᾶμι, Ion. and Abi. ἵστημι ; Dor. ndpd,
Ion-Att. κόμη; but Dor. σοφίᾶ ἁμέρᾶ πρᾶσσω, Ion. σοφίη ἡμέρη
πρήσσω, Abt. σοφίᾱ ἡμέρᾱ πρᾶττω. Pure Attio is naturally found
only in inscriptione, oi which a large number have been dis-
covered3 but the literary language which comes nearest to it
γ is that of the comedies oi Aristophanes and especially that of
the dialogues of Plato,

(e) During the period of' Athenian supremacy, the poli-
tieal influenoe of Athens caused the Attio dialect to spread ,
throughout all (imeae, and this, expansion gave birth to an
artificial language, the κοινὴ διάλεκτος, which served as acommon
bond between all parts of the Hellenic world, and from the
time of Alexander began to supersede¹ the local dialects.¹ The
κοινή, with the exception of a few sounds or forms exclusively
confined to the language of Athens (ττ for σσ, etc), is essentially
identioal with Attio. 'I'his is the language taught by our
ordinary grammars. It is the languagc in general use by prose
writers subsequam to the age of Periclea, so far, that is, as
they do not, like Lucian² affect to imitate Attio; it was con·

¹ In the same way, from the time thet Franco became united under one
monarchy. the lauguege oi the contre (lle-de-France Orleaneis and Tou-
raine) having become the only literary and official language, gradually super·
seded Picardian, Norman, Bmgundhn, Provencal, and other provincial
dialects.
