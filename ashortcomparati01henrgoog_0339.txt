2. The false stem in α of the sigmatic aorist pasees into
the middle with no modification: ε’λειψάμην (for *t-Md-ppv),
ἔσχισάμην, ε’λῦσάμην, etc.

3. Thematic: ἐλαβόμην, ἐλιπόμην, ε’φινγόμην, etc.

(286). 111. Paneiou-The stem of the two passive aorists of
Greek shows not the least trace of gradation, and it may be
doubted whether any gradation ever existed in its flexion, ep.
ε’τύτην ε’τύπημεν, ἐλέχθην ἐλέχθημεν, for not a traco of it sur·
vives in the Latin forms jaces jacet jacemus, which, apert
from the augment, exactly coincide with ἐτύτης ἐτύπη ε’τύττημεν.1

(287) Ι. ΙΙ. Actiuc ared clienta-1. The only regular sub-
junctive is naturally that with short thematic vowel,2 of which
many examples are found in Homer, ay. καταβήομεν, στήομεν,
δώομεν, γνώομεν, θήομεν, θήομοι, βλήεται, but which was super-
seded iu the classical language, as in the present, by the sub-
junctive with long vowel, στῶμενεστέωμενεΗοοι. στήομεν,θῇ

εθὲηεΗοω. θήῃ, βῶμεν, θῶμεν, θῶμαι, etc.

2. The sigmatic aorist subjunctive with short vowel was lihe-
wise very common in the Homeric dialect, cy. βήσο-μεν (ΙΙ. i.
144), and survived up ιο the end with the functiones a future
indicative;³ but in its original function it was superseded
by a subjunctive with long vowel, which may very well have
been originally a future subjunctive,4 λέξομεν, λέξομαι.

3. In the thematic aorist the long vowel appears, end pre-
sente no difficulty: λάβω, λάβωμεν, λάβωμαι, οιο.

III. Poenive-The regular subjunctive with short vowel,
Hom. τρατήομεν, δαμήετε, superseded from the time of Homer
by a subjunctive with long vowel, δαμήῃς, φανήῃ, the only form
recognised in the classical language, (τυπέω) τοτῶ, (τνπέιομεν)
τυπῶμεν, λεχθῶ λεχθῶμεν, etc. In Latin the form jaceo exactly
corresponds to τοτέω, and, being taken for an indicative, must
