superseded in Attio, and already to some extent even in Homer,
by a nominative with a nomina] termination‚ τοιοῦτον τοσοῦτον.

3. Stem κεῖνο· (that): Hom. κεῖνος and ἐκεῖνος, Attio prose
‘actvm Lesbian κῆνος, Dor. κῆνος and τῆνος. Its origin is
obscure 3 it has no special peculiarity.

4. Stem αὐτό- (pronoun denoting identity): the oxytone accen-
tuation seems to separate it etymologically from the preceding
otems,l but in any case it has been entirely assimilated to them
in its deciension

5. Stem e: relative pronoun ὄ·ς rid (=*‹i-d)‚ identical with
Sk. yde μά pit-d, which ,presupposes a primitive stem *yon
‘Phe epigraphic form (Locr.) idn, like the adverbial ablativa ὡς,
seems to belong to a different stem *owe-‚2

6. Stems πο· τι· u-=I.-E. *qo- *qi- *qe-:3 interrogative and
indefinite pronouns (enclitios in the last case).

A. *vd-3 πᾶ πό, Ion. *nde κή κό, not used in the nominative,
but frequent in the other case85 πῶς πόθεν ποῖ ποῦ πόθι, Ion. κῶς,
etc, cf. comparative πότερος and κότερος.

B. τί-ς ri=Lat qui-s quid. As is shown by Latin and
Sanskrit‚ the stem ends in -i-: hence the acc. sing. maso-fem.

'should be *ri-v. To this form *τί-ν was pleonastically added a
new accusative suffix, τίν-α, and from τίν-α was formed the false
stem τιν-, on which nearly all the deolension is based:4 sing.
τίν-α rev-ds τιν-ι’ ; pl. τίν-ες riv-ae τίν-α τιν-ὣν. But the true stem
τι· is still traoeable 2-(a) in the nom-acc. sing. nent, ri=*n'-d;
(β) in the loo. pl. τῖ-σί, which cannot be explained through
*riv-053 (γ) in the word ἅσσα, Att. ἅττα (nom-acc. pl. nent), in
which the group σσ vr is simply the representative of the group
ry of the nent. pl. *ri-a=Lat. quim, pronounced as a mono·
syllable *hp-oal

¹ (li. illem. Soc. Licp. vi. pp. 96 and 139.

² The word ὡς in Homer otton makes a preceding vowel long by position 3
we must therefore read fols, ay. Il. iv. 471, vi. 443, eto. (li. however L.
Havat, lleloopea aanor, p. 371. ³ Gi. supra 57, 1.

⁴ Cf. supra 213.-Zend however has an accusative oia-emmim.

⁶ Sapra 39 0 δ. The initial α is simply the final a ot the neuter word
which necessarily preceded the enclitio ’τιας thus in Od. xix. 218, we ought
really to read Ι’ὀπποῖά cca instead oi ‘emt' docem oi. in Frenoh m'omie
(my dear) written ma onie, whence the word um mie. [So in English a nodder
has become on addar, and conversely on elce-name (ie. an additional name)
ie now o toreama]
