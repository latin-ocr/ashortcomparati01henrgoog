cunco-usum voonmsu. 49

Lat. jer-o and probably (candela-pram (that which beary
a candle); certainly prend-o and prend-us. '

(β) In suffix. ek. nvi-ov, voc. κύ-ον, gen. κυ-ν-ός, cf. Lat. caro

car-ads (reduced), homo hom-in-n3 ek. accus. ιτα-τέρα, gen.
πα-τρ-ος.
’ D.-Simple ἔ not liable to disappear. Lu. types, *spele and
*step (to see), weah *epek aud *stela deflected *skop3 Gk.
σκέπῆο-μαι and σκοπ-ή (watchtower)‚ (ἕπί-)σκοπ·ο·ς (overseer);
Lat. tego and teg-a, etc.

2. Norntol form ἄ, ὄ. Here the question is complicated, for
it is not even certain that a syllable iu the normal form can
contain any short vowel except& hence the degree here called
normal may possibly have been originally a reduced form.
The following are some of the most certain gradatione: (1) d,
Gk. ἄγω (στρατ-)ᾶγ-ό-ς ἀγ-ωγή, Lat. ‹ty-o (amb-Myce and ἔφη
Gk. αἵθ-ω (to burn) ἰθ-αρίνς (clear), Lat. aed-es aes-tus (heat)
’ ’td-rte (pl, nights when-there is a full moon); (2) ὅ, ‹ivr-nopae
(Ι shall see), perf. ὄπ-ωπ-α, with no other grade; in Latin, only
one grade‚ dc-ulu-e.

3. Narmal form a, e, ὁ. d is reduced to d and deflected to ὂ.
LE. *bled (to speak), reduced libbe, deflected *th Gk. φᾰ-μί,

φᾶ-μᾶ, φᾶ-μέν lst plur.‚ devii (voice), Lat. fri-rt and sd-tcor;

Gk. ἷ·στᾶ-μι, aor. ἓστᾰ-ν, but στᾶ-τό-ς, etc„ Of. Lat. sid-re,
stamen (werp), and stet-tus (state), stri-tus (fixed), sid-bilis,
eremo. There is even perhaps in στύω (Ι plaee)=*cr-nioa
trace of a grade reduced still further by the complete dis-
appearance of the ἄ.

This ultra-reduced grade also exiets in the case of e and 03
the deflected grade is ὂ, coaleseing in the case of ὁ with the
normal grade. Everything tende to show that the ordinary
reduction resulted in d, agradation which is observed pretty
faithfully in Latin; eg. ee-rnee stt-teos, dena-m dd-tu-s. But
Greek, in imitationes the relation of ἵστᾶμι to στᾶτός, created
agradation τίθημι bertrand δίδωμι δοτός, which is equivaleut to
saying that in Greek e was generally reduced to ἔ and ῠ to ὃς

¹ Br being equivalent to thr, reduced form of the root *blrer (to bear). So
also ret-opat (I am). eor. ἐ-πλ-6·μην. πέτομαι (Ι fly) and ἐπτόμην, etc.
