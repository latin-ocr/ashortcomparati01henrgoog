similarly in the pluperfect subjunctive, audiissem, whence
audissem, amassem, nossem, etc.

(149) V. Suffic *·es·e‘1- of the pluperfect indicative.-
Whatever is to be thought of the form erat, it seems pretty
clear that it must have served as a model scisceret, that is to
say, that the language, when once in possession of the ratio
of eat to eru-t, derived thence, by a clumsy but easily con-
ceivable proportior, the ratio of feci-t to fuer-ut, to express
the past tense of the perfect. If, however, we wished to
establish a closer connexion between the Greek and Latin
pluperi'ect, we should call attention to the fact that the form
sec-eruero, for example, bears to ε’-λε-λοίπ-ε-αε*ε’-λε-λοίπ-εσφῃ
¹ exactly the same relation as er-am to ἦα (I was)=*v’yu-rp
(without augment *iu-rpem in other words, that in both cases
Latin has the group um corresponding to rga, a correspondence
phonetically impossible. Hence we should reconcile every-
· thing by restoring *cr-em, *secer-em, etc, and supposing that
&became α under the influence of the imperfect terminations
in -bct (cf. erlis and amahus). The choice remains open be-
tween these two explanations. The only point that is certain
is that this suffix erct- of the pluperfect is added without dis·
tinction tc all the possible forms of primary, secondary‚ and
tertiary peri'eots of all conjugatione.

(150) VI. Sufflec -εὲ- in the imperfect and pluperfect sub
junctius—From the form *es-se-ue on the one hand, and
the infinitivo forms fier-e and es-ecl on the other, there was
easily obtained the fourth proportional, *fier—em, aud thence
legerem, caperem, in short the exact parallel between tho in-
finitivo and the imperfect subjunctive, which was naturally
lengthened in the other conjugations, aurare amarent, necuere
nocuerunt, audire audirem. In the case of the pluperfect, it
seems that the clement -sse- of essem, being regarded as a
suffix, was added by analogy to the form feei, which was
· itself wrongly taken to be the perfect stem; hence sui-sseuffl
