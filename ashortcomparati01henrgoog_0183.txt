short vowel, which must have been regulated by fixed lsws.2
Here also analogy has been at work; iu the present it has
generalised the 011011Ι vowel, but in the other tenses and before
secondary nominal suffixos, φιλ-1100, err-‹ieOl-‘q-xu, πε-φιλ-η-μαι,
delecte, oderas, diherst-s, φιλ-η-τή-ς, etc, the long vowel
appears almost always, either because the analogy of the 10-
letion between λῦω and λῠσω3 introduced it into the future and -
aorist, whence it would easily spread to other forms, or because
every old contractiori is concealed in φιλήσωε1φύ1-ε-ῃέ-σω, 01

regular in certain forms oi the conjugation, was gradually ·

extended to other similar cases, and through them to the deri-

. The first is contracted in Latin, where it forms the 4111 con-

jugation, which has been greatly extended, either through ana-
logical creatione like sulctre from fulcrum, or m'ors especially
by attracting to itseli verbs in -io 01 the 3rd conjugation, such
as ven-io=liar'vo and 00111οε1110-μοιρ To this class belong
