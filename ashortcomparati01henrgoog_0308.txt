resemblance between the two types ἔχεε and εἶπεε*εἶπετ pro·
duced the type εἶπα, εἶπας, etc, formed like ἔχεα.

(246) Π. Druck-The lst pers. is wanting. The 2nd and 3rd
end respectively in υτον and -τᾱν (Dor. -τᾶν, Ion-Act. -rpv)=Sk.
-tam and -tum, lde-rou ε’·θέ-την, ε’·λύε-τον ε’-λυέ-την, &huon-ror
ἐ-λῦσά-την, etc. On account of their great resemblance and the
exact similarity of the corresponding primary endings,2 these
two forms were easily confused3 ·την is not unirequently found
for the lud person,3 and -τον for the 3rd.

(247) III. Plorat-l. Greek has two terminatione, -μες in
Dorio, -μεν in the other dialects, ε’-λύο-μες, ε’-λύο-μεν. The first
would correspond to Lu. lones, cf. sk, -mas; the second to
Lm. *ouem or more simply perhaps LE. ’ll-ute (cf. Sk. -utcl
with a paragcgio ν, which was orIginally not permanent, but
afterwards became so. Now in Sanskrit these terminations
correspcnd respectively to the distinction between the primary
and secondary tenses: ὂὴάνᾱυιηαεεφέρο-μες, but allaboramus:
ἐ-φέρο-με(ν). Hence it is probable that Dorio extended the
primary ending to the secondary tensae, whereas the other
dialeots, on tho contrary, generalized the secondary ending,

Latin has neither ²¹¹²-mcs nor -me, but an ending peculiar to
itself, -mc'ts⁸=*-mds‘, which evidently has the same relation to-

’ the Dorio ·μες as the termination of aurp-65 has to that of patric

doublet, probably syntaotical, *chero-mes *bhdrocaoa of which
Dorio has generalised the first term, and Latin the second.
