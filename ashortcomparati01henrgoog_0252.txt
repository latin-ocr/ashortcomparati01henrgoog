*depeaer=*de9eues, etc, 31 (β) the comparatives in ·yos-, Gk.
μείζων complicated by nasalization, Lat. maj6r=*mttjor=
*moyen cf. nent. mojns==¹=mojcs3 (y) the perfect participles
in onos· (Gk. -ῖόσ- and tta), λελοιπώς (nent. λελοιπός, gen.
λελοιπότ-ος). ’

§ 3. Nominatioe with double case-sipn.

(202) Tho combination of both signs of the nominative isa
quite exceptione} corruption, ap. ἀλώπηκ-ς (gen. ἀλώπεκ-ος), but
is common to Greek and Latin and probably very ancient in
(Dor.) πώς and pes, which, as we have seen [supra 200, 41,
cannot go back to *nobe and *ped-s, where the vowel would
only have been long by position3 hence we must restore *nothe
and ped-s, cf. acc. atto and ped-cm? The Attio πούς ποῦς is
another corruption, still unexplained.

ἓ 4. Nominative-Accusative of rteuter nouos.

(203) In neuter nouns and adjectivae, the essential char·
acteristio of the nominative and accusative singular, which are
always identical, is the absence of any case-sign, as may be
seen at a glance by comparing them with the corresponding
masculinos.

1. Vocalic stems: Gk. ἵδρι, vivona-iore, γόνυ, γλυκύ; Lat.
caradochi, sorte, more, antamt=*onimolt‚-(arch.) pecti,
peuri, coraci (l).

2. Emptosive stema: Gk. γάλαε*γάλᾶκτ, μέλιε*μέλιτ, ἔπηλυ
(foreign)=*i⁷rpltol, masc-fem. ἔπηλυς, Lat. lac=*l(ict; but
adjectivae like audon, ferta, selim have assimilatod the neuter
to the masculine-feminine.

3. wt-stemst Gk. nte'fflnte'w, δεικνύν, τυφθέν, πᾶν,3 χαρίεν,
-φέρον = *φέρονῃ litu, etc.; in Latin, assimilation to the masc.-
fem, serens, prudens.

¹ In cirita, pulvis, the short vowel seems to come trom the obliquantem,
unless these words are neutors which have passed into the masculine decien-
eroum same double case-sign probably in voa (foy), lta (lipom), rea (repere).
