question qud. Hence it also seems preferable to see instru-
mentals masculine and neuter in the four Latin pronominal
forms quand, hac, illac, istac rather than tohave recourse to
a problematic ellipse of via, to justify the feminine.

8. Instrumental (ay-It is not certain that this case, the
sign of which in Greek is -φι- φιν,1 and which is not found in
Latin, existed in the singular in Indo-European3 at any rate
in Sauskrit it appears only in the plural, under the form -bhisfl
However that may be, this form, which classical Greek has
entirely lost, is still fairly common in Homerz³ δεξιά-φιν (on
the right), ἀριστερά-φιν (on the left), χαλκό-φιν (With bronze),
στρατό-φιν, niden, ἐκ πασσαλόφι (from apeg, Od. viii. 67),
etc.

9. Dotion-The primitive termination was ’‘l-ay, or perhaps
*-cy, but it makes no difference here which it was, since the
initial vowel can have had no other effect than that of lengthen-
ing by contractiori the final o· of the stem, ἵππῳ, equo:
*dlcwday or *cheud-cyfi This declension, together with that
of the ᾱ· stems, is the only one in which Greek has preserved
a true dative.

10. Locustae—On the other hand it has almost entirely lost
the locative, the sign of which was a simple -l; the only traces
of it are to be found in the forms ποῖ (whither?)=*qd-i, οἶ
(whither, relative),⁵ οἴκοι (at home), AEol. τυῖδε (here), ἅλλυι
(elsewhere). It will be seen that the final vowel of the stem
Ἴ has the form o, but the form e would perhaps be more regular;
at any rate it is certain that the form οἴκει existe and that Dorio
has adverbs like τεῐδε romei αι’πεῖ, to which may be added the
Panhellenic ἐκεῖ. The Latin locative, hamt (on the ground),
domi (ethome), leaves the question undeoided, since t may re-
present either ei or oi; the archaic form however is humei:
*humo-l. This very important form has only retained its loca-
