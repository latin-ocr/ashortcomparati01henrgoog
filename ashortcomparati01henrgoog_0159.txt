same analogical process, taking place in regard to the aorist
in ·θη-, produced the future λυ-θήσινμαι, herodii-repar, a form
which has become far more common than the preceding form,
but is still unknown to Homer.

Apart from certain formatione, which on account ot their
extreme rarity may be neglected,l these seven types of tenses
are the only primary verbal stems exclusively confined to

Greek.

§3. Latin Formations.

(104) Ι. &eme with suffic -e'r-: subjunctives of the 3rd
(secandarily also and and 4th) conjugation-This form, seen in
old Latin fat-oea, subjunctive of the obsoleto *fate (to be),
legum, 09000) cam=*eyaon(1 may go), is quite isolated.
It has been maintained that this -o- was the original sign of
the subjunctive, that consequently Greek ought to have had
*λέγᾱ-μεν instead of λέγωμεν, and that the latter formis due to
alater intrusion of the vocalism of the indicative λέγομεν. But,
as nothing hitherto has been discovered to confirm this conjec-
ture, it is better to regard as exclusively Latin this still
unexplained ᾱβ which also appears, as we have seen, in the
imperfect era-'on and the pluperfect fater-om, and will recnr
in the next suffix.

Π. Stcms with soffia -be't-: imperfecte t-bcarn, dabam,

stabas—If this suffixis merely the form fuam, that is, a ’

tense of the verb ‘f to be '² agglutinatod to the root and forming
with it a periphrastic conjugation, it should really come under
the head of secondary derivation, where it is very common.
The same remark applies to the next suffix, namely:

(105) ΙΠ. Stoma with saffiro -b0-: futures 1-10, dabo, sta-bc,
referred rightly or wrongly to the present *sarstono

¹ Ep. the suffix -κο- in ὀλέ-κω (to perish)‚ perhaps based on the perfect
ὁλ-ώλε·κ·α; and the suffix -χο-, which is shown by the existence 01 doublets
like τρύω τρύχω (10 wear away by rubbing)‚ σμάω σμήχω, poto ψήχω, aud 10

¹ M. L. Job (hiemsve. Lina. vi. p. 347) seems temeto have said the
last word in regard to this difficult question: the subjunctive in -ᾶ- origi-
nated in the verbs in -ctmi which in Latin became thematis (eg. *stratori
became 01016, snpra 87, Π), and thence it spread to the other conjugatione
