aq. Il. xii. 320)=*n2, instr. l-drflfl-dr (by force), common in
Homer, Lat. tat-s ; Gk. ῥῖγος, Lat. frigam ·t·, sign of the opta·
tiva, I.-E. *sd-mes (we may be), Gk. ‹spade-apa, Lat„
s-tanus, eto. Sometimes in Latin spelling this t is confused
with ei, ag. fosseis=saoet33 but we know that the pronuncia-

tion represented by both symbols was almost the same.

*tta (tc hear), Gk. κλυ-τό-ς (heard of, celebrated), Lat. with
prefix iactatam Gk. ὑπό,’ὖπέρ, Lat. sub, super 3 -u-, formative
suffix of nouns, Gk. adut-c (Dor. ἁδύς), Lat. audois=*svddd-is,
with an additional suffix, the vocalia character cf which caused
the change osa to a semi-vowel.

We have seen that Latin d was closely akin to ὅ. It

seems to have retained its original labial character when a
labier followed ; then in course of time this pure a'c must have
passed through the intermediate stage of o’t to a sound nearly*
approaehing that of t. These three stages are successively
attested by variable spellings, such as labet and libet (it
pleeses), carbasea and caruifeoe, lacrumo (of. Gk. δάκρυ),
lacrimuand even lacryma, perhaps also by the variation
seen in the dative-ablativos of the fourth deolension, eg. ured-
bus compared with maur-tas. But as we are here dealing
, with asound which the Latin alphabet was unable to represent
with precision, it is hard to reduce these phenomena to a law.
, On the other hand, al becomes pure ὅ before r, except in
a final syllable: fibra (to be)=*ft⁹t·re, cf. fal-tetrus and Gk.
φύ·ο-μαι; femdrds, jecor-is (genitivos), cf. femur, ject'tr, etc.
