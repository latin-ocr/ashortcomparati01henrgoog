mental condition, the physiological possibility of the changes
which have produced them. Every phonetic change, in fact,
such as that which has transformed Latink to i 1 in Frencb
cheocl=cabdllum, presupposes a series of innumerable uncon-
scious changes, which are so imperceptible that neither speaker
nor hearer has any suspicion of them at the moment when they
take place. For example, Picardian, which is less corrupted
than Ehenoh, has not gone beyond the stage of lc in kevd=
chevalr The origin of the latter form is probably as follows:
the tongue was slightly shiited, and came in contact with a
part of the palate not so far back as the place affected by the
. pronunciaticn of simple lc, and so there arose between the con-
sonant and the vowel a hardly perceptible palatal sound‚ which
may be approximately represented by y, loys. This sound in
its turn reacted upon the consonant3 and so the group became
approximately tye, from which itis but a very short step to tic,
as may be seen by experiment. .It is thus, ior example, that
Swedish pronounces the syllable which it still spells kjo'; and
this is the stage which hasbeen reached by a northern variety
of Picardian, the dialect of Tourcoing. Ii now the initial t
becomes merged and lost in the hissing sormd of the following
consonant, we arrive at the present French form tevdt. Of '
course the stages indicated above are only halting-places, as it,
were, between each of thern it would be easy to distinguish
further intermediate stages, which might be represented by tho

Unless we were able to restore some such series in thought,
it would be quite impossible to conceive and consequently to·
admit scientifically most phonetic phenomena; it is only on
this condition that they admit of being reduced to laws, rmder*
standing by law the expression of the constant and invariable
reproduction of a particular phonetic phenomenon during one
of the stages in the development of a given language. Pho-
netic lawe, resting thus on the double basis of the history·
of language and physiology, may be truly said, at any rate from

the standpoint ot' the methodos comparative philology, to have
