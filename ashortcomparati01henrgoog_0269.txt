ἀνήρ, the regular deolension of which would probably be: sing.
nom. ἀνήρ, voc. ἄνφ, acc. ἀνέρα, loc. *ἀνέρι or ἀνδρί, gen. ἀνδρός;1
pl. nom. ἀνέρες, acc. ἀνέρας or ἀνδρας, loc. ἀνδράσι, gen. ἀνδρῶν.
In Homer we often find the regular forms ἀνέρα and ἀνέρες,
but the ordinary language generalised throughout the whole
declension the weak stem ἀνδρα ἀνδρες ἀνδρας. ,

The same is the case in Latin. Except in the nom-voc, the

strong or middle form of these stems was lost, and patrem was
said instead of *ραάεν-εννεπατέρα, on the model of patri and

atris. ,

p In Greek the middle form was generalised in ἀήρ, αἰθήρ, ἀστήρ
(gen. ἀστέρος, hut Ιοο.ρ1.ἀστρά-σι), and other words, and the
long vowel of the nominative in all thenouns in ννήρ denoting
the agent: δοτήρ, δοτῆρ-α, δοτῆρ-ος, ’δοτῆρ-σι.

ΙΙ. Stems ic ·or-, -tor·.—There remains no trace in Greek
of a declension δάτωρ, ἀιδωτέρα (or δώτορα), *hosp-dr, if such a
declension ever existed. These forms show no gradation, with
the exceptiones the lengthening of the nominative: δάτωρ,
δώτορ-α, δώτορ-ος, δώτορ-σι.

In Latin, the long vowel of the nominative passed even into
the oblique cases: *dator datorem dator-is, eto: then, the
final syllables in r having been shortened‚ the result has been
that the nominative, which was the only case entitled to a long

’ vowel, is the only one that has a short vowel.

§4 Sigmatis Stcms.

(212) 1. Masculines and femininae in ·os-.-In Greek,
simply lengthening of the nominative: αἰδώς *aiddu-c (αἰδόα
αἰδῶ) *elide-or (αἰδόος αἰδοῦς). Latin shows more variety:
vocalic change without lengthening, venus oenenem=*vcnes·
eum lengthening without vooelic change, arbos arborem:
*arboc-cm. But, in the immense majority of cases, we find
a series of corruptions, some phonetic, some analogical, the
history of which is as follows3 originally hones *hoedo-is,
extension of the long vowel of the nominative, *honos-i33
rhotacism, honor-is, analogioal extension of the ν to the
nominative, *bonor ; shortening of the last syllable, honor.
