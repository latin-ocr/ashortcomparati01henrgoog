§ 1. Iadicetive.

' (292) I. Achae-The original gradation of the radical per-
lect¹ differs very little from that of the other tenses: in the
indicative active, the lst sing. had the deflected grado, faida,
or perhaps the normal grade, ep. *feiha3 the aad end ere
sing. certainly had the deflected grade, fcio-Oc, foihq all the
other forms had the weak grado, Fid-peu, etc. This perfect οἶδα,
the inflexicn of which we have already seen,2 isa valuable
relic, almost unaltered, of the old alternation, Other examples,
though less complete, are no less convincing; for they all go
beck to Homer, and were only gradually eliminated in later
Greek, The following are the most certain examples: γε’-
yov-a, pl. γέ·γα-μεν--*γέ·γῃ-μεν; με’-μον-α, pl. με’·μα-μεν, dual
με’-μα-τον; πέ-πονθ-ιι (I have suffered), 2nd pl. πέ-πασ·θε (ΙΙ. iii.
“ 99, Od. x. 465, Aristarchus's correction for the impossible
πέποσθε)ε*πέ-πζιθ·τε, cf. παθεῖν; δέδδοιι (Ι tear), which is restored
in Homer in place of δείδω (false present, really eontracted from
recha), and is equivalent to *de-dioec (root dfe, cf. δέοςε
*etet-oe), pl. δέδδιμεν (written deidtpev)=*de'-dic-pev, Art. δέδιμεν,
etc.

The principle of uniformity acted in two different directions. ’
Sometimes, but very rarely, the weak form of the plural and
duel prevailed throughout the whole of the flexion3 thus,
for example, on δέδιμεν was based the classica] form δέδια, on
*ἐλήλῦθμεν the classica] ἐλήλῦθα, which superseded the Homerie
εἰλήλουθα,3 on γέγαμέν, μέμαμεν, the Homerie 3rd plurale γεγάᾶσι,

pepulere, which would presuppose in the lst sing. iye‘yaa, '

*μέμαιι and the same may be said of the Attio forms ἑστᾶσι.

¹ ¹ Supra 87, 111. ² Supra 252.
⁸ conversely εἰλήλουθμεν (ΙΙ. ix. 49).
