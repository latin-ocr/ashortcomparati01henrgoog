FURTHER contemneretis OF voWELs AND GONSONANTS. 81

φιλέετε.1 εψη becomes η, but is uncontraoted in Ionio: φιλῆνε
εφιλέητε. elz becomes e: Hom. πτόλεϊ, Act. πόλει. c÷o ‚be-
comes Dor. m, Alb. ου (pronounced d or c'l): φιλοῦμενεφιλέομεν ;
Ionio texts sometimes have εο dissyllabis, sometimes εο mono-
syllabis, sometimes also ευ (Herodotus), which was of course
pronounced as a diphthong, aud scarcely differed from mono-
syllabic εο. ÷÷ei becomes ω Att· φιλῶτφιλέω, ἃνθῶνεάνθέων.
Even when the ε was retained in writinge it was not rechoned
as a vowel, and in forms like βασιλέως, πόλεως, contractiori
probably took place in current pronunciation, though never
denoted in writing.3 c÷v (rare) becomes ευε Hom. ἐΰς (good),
Ate. εὖ (well).

4. The group n÷ vowel is of little importance except in
Ionio, Attio, and the κοινή, where it replaces the primitive
group ᾶ ÷ vowel; it then becomes subject to the laws of
abbreviation and metathesis of quantity peculiar to those
dialects, which will be discussed later on (infra 76).

5. The group ι ÷ vowel is never eontracted3 but ι, like ε,
sporadioally became a semi-vowel. The rare group u however
became} in the locative πόλῐ (Homer andHerodotus)= πόλιν,
cf. prr. πτόλιμι, anda few similer cases.

6. The very rare groupt ÷ vowel is not conti-acted.

7. 0. 0÷a becomes Att. and Lesb. e, Dor. ᾱ, in Ion. often
remeius in hiatus: Dor. πρᾶτος, Ait. πρῶτοςτ-*πρό-ατο-ς; Att.
aecus. aido=oibom 041'1 is unimportant. 0÷e becomes ov,
δηλοῦτεεδηλόετε. οψη becomes ω, δηλῶτεεδηλόητε; the Att
fem. διπλῆ (double)=8ml6y‚ like its plural dvnhui=drrrhdut ancl
neuter pl. διπλᾶεδιπλόα, is due of course to the analogy of the
uncontracted termination. o÷r becomes or: Att. οἶς (sheep)=
ὄϊς (Theocritus)=*6frs, Lat. cois. 0·l·0 becomes Lesb. Dor. ω,
lom-Act. ov: gen. Lesb. Dor. ἵππω, Ion-Act. ἵππουεῆπποο (but
υ-Ι-οι simply gives οι, δηλοῖμενεδηλόοιμεν). ο-Ι·ω becomes m,
δηλῶμενεδηλόωμεν. οψυ is unimportant.

8. ω. The group e÷o becomes ω in Ion-Ati. gen. λεώ (of

¹ The hictus ouen remeius in Herodotus.

suidas, spelt ἀνθέων.
