tongue resting flat on the bottom of the mouth, and the glottis
permitting the air to pass through it without any obstacle.
Neither sound nor noise can then be produced, except that
during the momente of expiration, a gentle current of air
passos through, which contains in itself the potential ueteranos
of a vowel). This is the inaudible sound which in certain
modes of writing is represented by a particular symbol, the
Greek soft breathing, the French and Spanish h. If the air
is expired withmere energy and a certain amount of affort,
we, have the German or English lt, very improperly called
aspirated. '

2. The organs being in the first position, the 'soft palate is
raised and cuts off all 'communication with the nasal cavities;
at the same time the vocal chords contract and vibrate. In
this way epure or oral vowel is produced, a, i, u, etc.

3. If the vibration takes place without the soft palate being
raised, the vowel is sounded in both cavities at the same time,2
and so we obtain a nasalized vowel, written in French aa,
in, un, etc.

4. If the mouth, when in the third position, is„ closed by
means of the lips or the tongue at any point, then the air
expired being only able to escape by the nostrils, no oral
vowel can be produced. The result is a nasa] sound, m, n,
oto.

5.³ The open mouth lets the current of air pass through;
but its passage is impeded by an elastic obstacle, which it dis-
places, and which returns to its original position with a rapid
alternate quivering or trilling sound. This sound is a trilled
r, of which there are several varietieS, distinguished according
to the different organs employed in producing them.

’ 6. The mouth is open, but the tongue completely obstructs

¹ That is, supposing the position to romain unchanged, then, as soon as
the vocal ohords vibrate. a vowel will be heard.

² This ean easily be proved by experiment. Δ looking-glass placed in

consequently the nasel onvity plays no part in the productior of seond,
except in the ease ot persons who speak through the nose.
