3. i, b-c' is generally contracted only when another i fol—
lows: abstollat, atharim, Valeri (gen.)= Valerit;¹ doubtlese
also when ἔ follows, for audis (thou hearest) may go back to
*cudi-fs or *cudi-es, but fale can only go back to *felte (cf.
however fe uncontracted in pietas, eto.); certainly never when
ciollows: paries (wall), capies (thou wilt take), atel In

proper names like Clodis=Ciodiuc common in old inscriptione, ’
we have doubtless merely a graphio abbreviation, certainly not
a contractiori.

4. o, 6.—oci‚ oe, οό become ὁ, ο.ς.,οό90, promo=*proemc‚
copia. oc becomes oe in coept=*oo-e'pi (cf. opimo-r).

5. u, deu seems to be contracted only with another u, in
gen. sing. macerationum (f)=*manuoa (in inscr. senatuoe);
still muntium (gen. pl.) and mincidnt (third pl.) make this
restoration somewhat doubtful. Hence itis difficultto believe
than nom. pl. manate is contracted from *mantea

connection, as a general rulo, does not take place when the
second vowel is accented; hence the difference between cerie
:rueras and aenus=fceenua cf. cleomedes, coepi. The con·
traction in coepi must have first originated in *coeptare being
afterwards transferred by analogy to *corpu and so also in
many other cases. On the other hand, analogy has often, as in
Greek, produced uncontracted forms: coalesco has been formed
on the analogy of codluc, coemo on that of coemamus, and
prohibes (we should have expected prober, cf. debes) shows
the influence of perhibes and madore.

ELISION.

(74) When there is no contractiori (crocia) of the final vowel
of one word and the initia] vowel of the next word, it very
often happens that the first'vowel entirely disappears before
the second, as in the numerous elisione indicated by Greek

¹ Contraction is the rule in the genitivos of proper names; in those of
common noune and adjectives, pollii, patrii, the analogy of the other cases
and the need of cleerness either kept or restored the grcup ii.

² Hence the subjunctive ria cannot come from the archaic aie-r.
