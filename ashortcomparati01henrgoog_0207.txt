⁴ OOMPOSITION.

(175) Oertain derivativas, as we have seen, may be oom-
pounds in disguise‚ in the sense that their apparent suffix con·
ceals a significant root; but composition properly so called
exists only when several seems, each oi which taken by itself

¹ has retained its meaning in the language, coalesco and form a
single word, in whioh the meaning of the one is determined by
thot of the other: μεγαλό-πολις, ttici-scr, porte-feudis, sonnon-
schein, opple-trec, eto. This process, which was already oon·
siderably developed in the Indo-European language‚ has been
carried still further in olassical Sanshrit‚ where the power oi
composition is almost unlimited. Greek on the contrary seems
to have restricted it, so iar at least that it scarcely allows
any compounds of more than two terms3 it has however
extended it, inasmuch as it possesses a whole class of com-
pounds peculiar to itself, namely those in which the first term
is verbal, ἀγέ·στρατος. In Latin the power oi composition is
much smaller and much less varied than in Greek ; and, if the
Romanoa languages‚ which are themselves greatly inferior in
this respect to the Teutonio languages‚ are still fairly well pro-
vided with compounds osacertain class, they have developed
nearly all of these¹ by opening up entirely new pathe, unknown
to the Latine.

¹ The prevailing type of compound in these langusges ie thot in which
the first term is verbal: Frenoh corpe-porco (out-throat place), tircbocohon
(eorl-sorew) ; Ital. porratempo [pastimc]; sparnac-moro 1⁰·kill-the-Moor,’'
niokname ior a boasting soldier]. oi. Gk. oye-orares. [01. English cut·
throni, tany-doc, dore-devii, etc]
