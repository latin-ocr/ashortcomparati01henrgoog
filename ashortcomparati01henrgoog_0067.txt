of an ο (διδούςϋδιδόντς). The close c and the diphthong both
imperceptibly became at from classical times. In fact we know
that in transliteration from one language to another, Latin
. rt and Greek ου are treated as exaotly equivalent3 cy. Λούκιος,
Thucydides. Ι
(25) Besides these diphthongs in which the vowel came first,
there is no doubt that Greek possessed also numerous diph-
thongs‚ in which the semi-vowel came first (type yc end wc).
This is especially shown by Greek'prosody. Thus the Homerio
scansion cf ypiorov-or (AEolic) χρύσιον as a dissyllable, ol
' Αἰγυπτίους as a trisyllable (ey. Od. iv. 83), of Πηληιάδεω (Ionio)
with synizesis os δεω, and the frequent scansion in the tra
gedians of θεῶν as a monosyllable, and ἀνθέων (Attio) as a dis·
syllable, point beyond doubt to a semi-vocalia pronunciation ol
ε or ι; so also the word υἱός, which is always dissyllabic, must
have begun with a sound very nearly akin to the English wit.
But owing to the lack of precision in Greek writing, and the
absence of other evidence, we are not able to arrive at any·
thing beyond approximatione on this point.

ἓ 2. Latia.

(26) 1. Voreda-The Latin vowels are five in number, a, c,
i, c, u,¹ and may be either short er long. The Latin alphabet
has no special sign to denote along vowel; sometimes in
inscriptions the length is marked by doubling the vowel
(lisseiaco)2 or in the case of i by lengthening the letter (Manln,
ablative), or, lastly, by the use, very irregularly however, ol
the apex, a kind of acute aocent placed over a vowel long by
nature.

Tho pronunciation of the Latin vowels is much better known
than that of the Greek, their equivalence in inscriptions, the

¹ Y, a horrowed symbol, as we have seen, ought never to appear except
iu Greek words which the Latius introduced into their own turgange,

hence we shall write paterniacensi, systum, but silua, luerim, inclutus

orypyertpfimmy ot the vowel must always be carelully distinguished from

that ol the syllable ; thus the c alciatus is rechoned as long because cl ite
position, but it is really short; on the contrary, in syrtica, lectus, etractus,
the vowel is long by nature, and quite independently ot the group of con
sonante which follows it.
