etc, must go beck to alost participle which had short ο or
rather u, in accordance with a very common vowelchange
(iufm 41 and 117).

B.-I.·E. cy gives in Greek ωι, in which ι ie written but no
longer pronounccd, and in Latin o, in which the i is not even
Ι written: dat. sing. Gk. imp=equa I.·E. cio, which is unim-
portant, is likewise reduced to c in Latin, eg. motus (motion)=
*mea-tua, cf„ move-o, moui. ’

A.-Simplc ct: I.-E. {apa (tc make, lead), Gk. ἄγω, Lat.
apa ; I.·E. *auti (against, before), Gk. ἀντί, Lat. autc ; Gk. cyp-a ’
(to prese, squeeae), Lat. cup-6, cf. anquis (snake), Gk. ‹ty-pte

In Greek this d undergoes no modification. But in Latin

(a) Einal a, which is however very rare, becomes ἔ, like final
ὅ, il the instrumental cedd, preserved in AEolic as an adverb
(with), really corresponds to a form peu-e=*pcac, confused
with the locative ped-e=*pcd-i, perhaps also with an ablativo
*ped-cd, and to be connected with I.-E. stem *pict (scot).

(β) Unaccented d, when not final, generally becomes i,which
, remains in a close syllable, factus confectus, captus acceptus,
cup-ic auceps (bird-catcher), cap-ut prae-caps, etc.; but be-
comes i in an open' syllable, conficio, accipie, and the genitives
participia, prae-cipitia.l In the latter case, however, before
alabial, i alternatae with ai, gen. aucupis, aucupia-m (bird-
⁴catching); and we often find both spellings in use for the same
word, mancupium and mancipium (capia), which points to the
presence in these words of a vowel intermediate between u
and 212 In concutio (qualia) and aupurium (paulic, ci. Gk.
’γηρύωεγᾰρύω, to cry), the ic may doubtless be explained as
being due to the influence of the preceding consonant, compli-
cated more or less by labialination. We also find u beforel
in close syllables: salto curulia, calco couculc6‚³ etc. Einally,

.⁸ l in a close syllable produces labialiaation oi the preceding vowel (cf.
French altre, which hae become autre, and English sulae, ull), and we shall
aee that the weukening of au produces u.
