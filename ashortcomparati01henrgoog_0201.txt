Besides ·iaco, which is borrowed (daemoniacae), Latin also
shows exaotly similar phenomena: ·co- in hos-ticcam ·ico in
arb-icas, sontica-c (real), -tico in raetica-s, letne-tiores,
eto.; then a combination of the affix ·e‘o- with the two pre·
oeding ones, patr-ic-icac, flc-tieices (imaginary), the last type
being very common in legal and post-classieal Latin, recepticiue,
adventicius (wrong spellings fictitias, etc).l

This suffix -ko, which is so rarely primary and so often
secondary, may fittingly conclude the list of suffixos which
are both primary and secondary. The following suffixos are
always secondary.

(163) XVIII. Safficcs ·do·‚ ·don-‚ eta—It is true that
we can already recognise in primary derivativas a few traces
of a suffix beginning witha dental, Gk. κλψδών2 (renown),
κρύβ-δην (secretly), φύγ-δα (to flight); but here the secondary
. formatioris, which are infinitely more numerouS, seem to have
served as models. Tharais, in the first place, to mention only
the chief instanees, the Latin type in do, ido, which is so
common in adjectives, heroidas,³fler-ians, and which might
possibly have some very indirect connexion with the gerundivo
type in -ndo, cf. the adjective rot-undere from roto (wheel).
Its Greek correlative seems to be the suffix -δό-, -ηδά of adverbs
like ssadpn-pbd-t‘ (by steps), ortX-de-v‘ (line by line). Next comes
the suffix -δᾶ-, -ιδᾰ-, -ιαδᾱ- of AEolie patronymica, ey. Κρον-ίδψῆ
lastly, the suffix -don-, somewhat rare in Greek, ily-pide
(suffering), but very common in Latin in somewhat obscure
formatione, and preceded sometimes by a nasal, ar-un-do (reed),
hir-ande (swallow), sometimes by a long vowel, hir-ct-dc
(leech), tibi-dc, cupide. Itis very possible that- this last
class does not really contain a suffix -den, but has a phonetic
origin similar to that of the suffix -tctdo already analysed.4

¹ Tharais some doubt ae to the suffix cec- seen in the forms paderna and
’ antennor (also antaeus). Another variant -r'nquo- occurs in tany-laquea,
priphibfnuffllppbdvo (Od. iv, 317) and κλεηδόνι (od. xviii. 117).

³ The explanation of this form as being due to composition with the root
do,(tpug,irvae)1⁴5‘4gwing grass,'' ete, seems not at all probable.
