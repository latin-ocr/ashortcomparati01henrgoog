to those elemento whose addition determines the precise shade ’

of meaning to be attached ιο the vague and general meaning
contained in the root. A suffix then is everything which, ὓ
in a given word, occurs between the root and the termina·
tions of declension or conjugation, ey. -σι- in θέ·σι-ς, -ud- in
θονμό·ς, -σαυρό- in day-oavpds, -μά·ο· in τῖ-μάο-μεν, etc. The de·
clinable or conjugable combination thus formed, ey. dira,
θωμό·, findo, is called the stem (theme, radica] [or hase]). A
stem is called primary, if only one suffixis attached to the
root, τῑ·μή,; secondary,ii there are two, that is, if it is de-
rived from the primary stem just as the latter is derived from
the root, ey. ὠμά-ο derived from τῖ-μή just as τῖ-ο- is from the
root τῐ-, lst sing. pres. ind. τῐμάω, τίω; tertiary‚ if there are

. three, τῖ-μα-άμενο, andso on. But, as the same processus are

reprodnced indefinitely in all the stages of derivation, it is
sufficient, for the purpose of studying derivation as a whole, to
distinguish between primary derivation, comprising forma-
tione derived directly from the root, and secondary deri-
vation, including all othere. These, together with nominal
. composition, will form the three branchos of our study of
etymology.
