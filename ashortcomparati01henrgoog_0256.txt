But the opposite phenomenon also took place, and that too
over a much wider area: that is, the termination -e of the
ablative (locutive) of consonantal stems was extended to the i·
stems‚ and on the model of pede, patre were formed ave, ove,
agae, colle, torre) etc. ’ The regular termination scarcely ever
remained unohanged except in the neuters (mure, animal),
where it prevented the confusion of the ablative with the
nominative? and for the same reason in the declension of
adjectivae in αἱ, wi· and -zr'-. ¹

ln Greek the ablative of the 3rd decl. is entirely wanting.
But the termination of the adverbial ablativos of the 2nd (σοφῶς)
was wrongly extended to the ard, and from βραδύς, σαφής,
διαφέρων were formed the adverbs βραδέως (slowly), σαφέως
σαφῶς (clearly), διαφερόντως (differently), Hom. τεχνηέντως (οἇ. V.
270), just as if the stems were *sspude'e, *σαφέα-, *σαφό-, *δια-
φέροντο-,θέα3

7. Ablatioe (ny-It is possible that the form ὀνόματος, which
is usually regarded as a genitive, ought to be divided ὀνόμα-τος
and explained as an ablative in dos from the stem ὀνομα·; from
this form and from the nom. pl. ὀνόματα would come the inter·
polated τ of the Greek declension‚ which is wantingin the Latin

’ africia-ia.4 We find the same ablative in Latin radic-idua, with
the insertion cf an i on the analogy of fund-idus.

8. Abletc've (ill—Some examples of this are found in Homer,
ἧρῶ-θεν (from the dawn), usually with the insertion oia con-
necting-vowel ο on the analogy of the -ostems and the genitive
πατρός,5 aq, acted-deu, Δι-ὁ-θεν, ἁλ-ό-θεν.

9. Instrumeatol (1).-1f, as there is a tendency to admit, the
sign cf this case was *aa we may recognise it in ἅμα (together),
perhaps in παρ-ά (cf. gen. πάρ-ος, dal. παρ-αι’, loc. περ-ι’, which are
used as prepositions) and in πεδά, which was used by the

¹ Thus αυέ 2 avt (dat.) =potre ε patra.

² Hence the analogy in question must have taken place aiter the change
ol final tto e (orore=*mart)‚ but before the loss of the final vowel of animal
:animalia

³ It will be seen that the confusion between two systema of inflexior has
been the chief cause of the deviatione in declension in both languages ; but
in Greek it is the 2nd decl. which has had a preponderating influenee, in
’ Latin the declension of ·i-stems. We shall find many exemplos ol thie.
