by analogy give rise to the other infinitives, layca-e, cap-erc,
etc. The forms dave, sta-rc, csse, scr-rc, cel-lc, are still more
primitive, andare formed by the addition to the root of a simple
-s-, the reduced form of thesemo suffix of which -os· and -eo
represent respectively the deflected and the normal gradal The
divergence into active and passive meaning which has taken
place between the endings ·ἔ and -c must be regarded as a
later development, as is shown by many synonymous uses and
by the active meaning of the infinitives 'of deponent verbs.
Nevertheless, this hypothesis still leaves partially unexplained
the type veh-t, lay-t in the infinitivo passive (we should have
expected *veh-cra) and the very common archaio type velatae,
loqulcr, aliter (Ep. Scip.), spargier (Horu), which it is difficult
to connect with spargi, etc.⁹

(126) XXII. Stems with aatffioees -ios aad yos-z Greek
and Latin comparatives.-The suffix appears in Greek under
a nasalized form -ιον-, nom. -ίων, which it also assumes in certain
cases in Sanskrit, ay. nom. mot-tyara (greater); in Latin, it
always has the form -o‘os- rhotaoized with analogical lengthen-
ing of the vowel, messuram. This suffixis very common under
one or other of these forms: Gk. μείζων (Ion. μέζων)ε*μέγ·
you, κρείσσων (Ion. xpt‘ooorv)=*xpe'r-yu›v (normal root of spur-155,
strong), βάσσων (Epicharmus) = *stt-yur, θᾶσσον (quicker)=
*θάχ-ῃον, but also βαθ-ίων, ὠκ-ίων, eto.;3 Lat. ocior, md(h)·jor,
pc-jov, prop-ior, eto.; in misor (cf. Gk. μείων) the formation
is obscure.

This suffix appears again under the reduced form ·io· in the
base of secondary formatione, Greek superlatives in acero,
Latin in -is-sumo, and others which will be seen later on.

(127) XXIII. stomacus suffic -ko, very rare in primary
derivation: Gk, elysey (box), which might also be divided θήκ-η;4
Lat. insufflatum, root unknown, pauci (few), cf. Gk.
ratpot, siccamus-tec, ct. sit-i-e.
