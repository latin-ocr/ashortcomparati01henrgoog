is concerned, whether this syllable belongs to the root or 10
0 suffix.

The gradation may include only 000 degree, when all the
cases are assimilated to one another, δοτνὴρ δοτῆρα δοτῆρας, sermo

δώτωρ δώταρα δώτορος, homo homiuem hamtai83 or three, that 10,
0 strong form, πατήρ, 0 middle form with the last syllable 01
the stem short, πατέρα, and a weak form with the 1001 syllable

So great indeed has been its lavelling influenoe that it is

Greek and Latin, with which alone we are now concerned) what
cases corresponded respectively to the strong, middle, and weak
forms 01 the 1001 syllable 01 the stem. All that we can say is,
that in all probability the nominative singular was a strong
case, the accusative strong or middle, the vocative and locative
middle, the other cases weak ,³ but Greek, which has confused
the locative with the dative, treats it 00 aweak case when 11
