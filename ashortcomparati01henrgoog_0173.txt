2. Puroaeytocea: in Greek the accent is always thrown back
as far as possible. Nowhere perhaps can the law which com-
bines theaccent with the normal form of the root bs more easily
verified; it is only necessary to compare the forms πένθ-ος (grief),
βένθ-ος (depth), xht'os:*xhe‘f-os (glory), μῆκ-ος (length), ἔρευθ-ος
(redness), etc, with the oxytones ποθ-εῖν (to suffer), (lad-ds (deep),
κλοτός (celebrated), μοκ-ρό-ς (long), ἐρυθρά-ς (red), etc. Still

there are not wanting in this class forms with the reduced
root: βάθος (depth), βάρος (weight), θάρσος (boldness), τάχος
(quiokness), πάθος (suffering), these must eitherbe referred to the
analogy of βαθύς, βαρύς, θορσθς, ταχύς, παθεῖν, or else the original
declension must have been βένθος *dud-rode, whence the doublet
βένθος βάθος. The form with deflected root ὄχ-οςε*ἱόχος (car),
of. ἔχω and veho, is due to the analogy of the secondary form
όχ-έ-ω (to carry).-In Latin we have: peu-us, tempus, fua-us,
ardu-us, etc, which are or seem to be normal ; robur, aequor,
where rhotacism has crept in from the oblique cases3 stcms
with the character of' the vowel uncertain, like opus, ort-ua
(cf. hoa-ds and the doublets decus decor), vola-ua, etc, lastly,
' pond-us and foedus, which certainly have the deflected root.l
(125) 3. Latia Infinitives.—If we compare, on the one
hand, a dative like qen-erc with an infinitivo passive like fi-erd,
audon the other hand, the locative (confused with ablativo)
pero-er-e=*peu-er-i with the infinitivo active type ster-ea it is
impossible not to be struck by the agreement and correspondence
which they show, both with one another and with the Greek
infinitivus in -μεν-αι and ·μεν.3 Hence, like the latter, the Latin
infinitivo seems to be, either the dative, *fei-caup, or the locative,
*fei-esd, of a stem in -cs-, *sci-cs·; thus caedar-e (to out) would
be the locative of acted-ca, adher-e (to veil oneself, marry) the
locative of nath-ea, veh-erc (to carry) the locative of *och-es·
(carrying), which is found also in the Greek ἔχ-εσ- (car), a
doublet of ὅχοςθ It is clear that a few forms of this kind might

¹ But the former at any rate originally belonged to stems of the 2nd decl..
wiglkdchrd'o, common in Plautus. aud exaotly synonymous with stara.
