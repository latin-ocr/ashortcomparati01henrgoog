(176) From the morphological pointel view, we must dis·
tinguish syntactical composition from non-syntectical
composition.

The latter, which is the only real kind of composition, con-
siste in the combinationes two stems or themes, of which the
first appears in the simplest thematic form, just as in secandary

derivation, ep. σεμνό-μαντι-ς, auri-secr, where the first term does
not differ from the primary stem on which have been based the
secondary stems σεμνό-τητ-, aaron. Thus, like derivatim, this
kind of composition goes back ultimately to the prehistoric
and quasi-sabulone period in which the bare stem without
affixos of any kind could appear in language and take the
function of a word in the sentence. These compounds are
as it were the fossile oi language, aad show us a host of
primitive elementa, combined and welded together, which
language no longer knows in their separate state.

Syntactical composition, on the contrary, is merely the juxta-
position and combination under one accent of two words, one
· of which, being subordinate to the other, is put in the case
required by the ordinary relations of syntax. Take, for example,
the two words Πέλοπος νῆσος, pronounced with two distinct
accents; it only requires every slight change to transform
them into asingle word Πελοπόννησος,1 in which the double ν
still points to the original σ of the genitive; and so also
the accent is the only point of difference between the Latin
scottus consultam and sanatas-conatuum. Latin has many
of these false compounds, eg. paterfamilias, resprihlico, venire
and cenum-tre (to be sold), pessum-dare (to destroy), maari-
missio (freeing), and they are not wanting in French, eg.

¹ We know that it ie essentially the single nocent which constitutas the
unity el aword. Olten indeed it is only a questiones writing.
