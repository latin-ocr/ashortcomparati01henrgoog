(δ) Final ὅ, which however is very rare, becomes 333 that is,
if we are to regard the imperative sequere as absolutely iden-
tical with its Greek correlative ἔπεοεΨέπ-ε-σο (follow).

(ε) But the most regular and by iar the best known change
of Latin ὅ is thet by which it becomes ti in a final syllable.
We find this change on a large scale in the nominative and
accusative singular of the second declension‚ where ands,
errem, densim are the normal equivalents of oinds, virore,
> donem, which are found in old inscriptions. So also in the
neuters oi the third declension, yends=Gk γένος, lampaia:
*tempta cf. ternpbrie; and in the third person plural present
indicative, leyrtrrt=Gk (Doric) λέγοντι, cf. tremonti (treceniet),
a doubtful form in the ancient Carmen Saliare.

ὅ was kept unchanged after an ci, whether vowel or consonant,
until aiter the Augustan age, when it began to undergo the
same treatment. Thus the Romans pronounced and wrote, and
it would be well for us also to write, eques, servos, eripede,
quom (conjunctim), not quum, which is a spelling belonging
to the latest period of Latin, and ought to be utterly rejected.
The labial consonant afterwards coalesced with the vowel of
the same class: whence the spellings ecus, cocus, cum, etc.l

While a following r seems to change ri to b, it also preserves
unaccented ὄ from being changed to ci; thus *tcmpds became
tetraptota, but temperis remained unchanged.

(ζ) We find also sporadicallyci instead of ὄ before a nasal

tollowed by a consonant; eg. angnia, cf. Gk. ὄνυξε *bray-r, and ’

the variation in spelling between bono and hunc.

B.-o in diphthonye.

(a) Ι.-Ε. oy: Gk. or=Lat. oi, but the last diphthong did not
remain permanently. When accepted, it became oe, and then
passed to the sound oi rt. Thus oino(rn), found in the epitaph
of the Scipios‚ became duram: cf. Gk. otri-r (one), οἰ-νή (the
ace in dice), 0i05(alone) = *oi-for: Zend occo (one), 1.-E.*0y-eo-s
deflected from a demonstrative root i. Similarly we may

¹So the declension would be approximately: eone, equa, equi, ecum, etc.
But it was inevitable that analogica] inflncncos should be developed among
the forme of this declension‚ giving riso, on the one hand, to the forms
equus, cyrrum, and, on the other. to the forms cce, eoi, all historicclly proved.
