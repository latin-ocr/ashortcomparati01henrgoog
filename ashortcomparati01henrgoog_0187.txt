aorists, fuir-pv τυπ-ε-ίη-ν, &hri-dur λυ-θε-ίη-ν, which were natu· i

rally influenced by the analogy of ἔθην θείην. Α much later
analogy substituted this formation for the following one in the

l

present optatives of contracted verbs: φιλοίην, τιμῴην, by the ¹
side of φιλοῖμι, τιμῷμι ;- and even in some optatives of thematic f

aorists, ‹rx-ofp-v, drapo-fem etc. Some see the same suffix

in the Latin subjunctive of the lst conjugation, eg. ames: ² ε

*amc—ye-s. Apart from this very doubtful case, it no longer

existe in Latin except in the reduced form ·t·, which was intro· ξι

duced from the plural into the singular, eg. facim :suc-s-i-m,

· eid-er-t-,r for *aru-er-ia-s=(}k. *iether-ivre (εἰδείης, opt. of perf.

oi a), through the analogy of the regular order-ranas& it

forms in Latin the' tense called perfect subjunctive, which is l

strictly a perfect optative.

The form of the future-perfect, videro, very greatly resem- ¹
„bles the last form. It differs from it however, not only in =,
the ist pers. sing, but also, at any rate originally, throughout,

in the quantity of its vowel i, which is always short; hence
it ought to be included in the preceding class. Thus we should

have ved-er-o=etbe'-o (I may know), ved-er-te=*uod-er-ce, and ,
the Latin future-perfect would be the regular perfect subjunc ἶ

tive (with short vowel), as oid-er-i-on certainly represents the
perfect optative.

VII. Sofflae -i-: optative of the thematic tenses. -Instead
of the alternation between -ιη- and -ῐ- which we have just seen,
Greek, which in this point agrees with Sanskrit, regularly
· shows in the optative of the thematic tenses onlya simple -ι-
between the thematic vowel and the termination, ap. λείπ-ο-ι-μι,
λίπ-ο-ι-μι, heir-coepi, etc. This formation has entirely disap
peared in Latin, unless we are willing to admit that lege-o
:My-on, or ames = *αῃιαῑεε *amabi-s, which is quite im-
probable.3

⁹ These quantitiee are archaic; in the classical period we have arderia,

we still find, for example, dederatis, Ov. Metam. vi. 357.

³ It will be seen that there is a troublesome uncertainty in the Latin
correspondencepl in classes V, VI and vr1; but this uncertainty is confined
within narrow 'mite
