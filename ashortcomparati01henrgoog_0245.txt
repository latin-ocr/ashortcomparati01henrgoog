planation has nothing against it except the single form
Theodoto, which is found on a Corcyrman inscription (the f is
almost inexplicable).1 Whatever may be the case in regard
to this, the AEolic iorm τολίτᾱο has regularly corresponding
to it, in Dorio πολίτᾰ, and in Ionio *πολίτηο, whence πολίτεω.
The genitives oi the κοινή in -ᾱ, ὀρνῐθοθήρᾶ, βορρᾶ are Dorisme,
of which the late Greek and modern Greek genitivos in -η,
Ἑρμῆ, are imitatione. In ancient Attio they appear to have
been unknown.

What then must be thought of the Attio and common Greek
genitive πολίτου, rapior? It has recently been attributed to
the contractiori of *τολίτεοεὴολίτηο But it would be very
strange, to say the least oi it, that Attic, in which, as we
know, metathesis oi quantity was so prevalent,2 should have
had *πολίτεο where even Ionio has πολίτεο, especially when it
has βασιλέως as contrasted with Ionio βοπιλέος. It is better
then to abide by the old view that πολίτου is simply due to the
analogy oi the ending -ov oi the and declension, which is itseli
-contracted from the -oo which produced τολίτᾶο. Thus analogy
again travelled along the same road which it had already taken
four centuries earlier, so much logie, wemight almost say
necessity, is there in its apparent caprices.³

Lastly we must mention the influence which has been
exorcised on these stemS, especially in the Ionio of HerodotuS,
by forms like Σωκράτης oi the 3rd declension, on account of the
identity oi their termination ς in the nominative; we find the
vocative Πρήξασπες, accus. δεσπότεα, eto. On the other hand
the acc. Σωκράτην, τριήρην, gen. Σωσθένου, eta, belong to the
best period of Attio.
