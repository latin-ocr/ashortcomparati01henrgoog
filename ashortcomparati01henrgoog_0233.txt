to the case-ending used in Greek for the genitive, locutive,
instrumental, dative, and ablativa duel. This terminationis
-ιιν (the first ι is a y) in the language of Homer, ἴππο-ιιν ὀφθαλ-
μοῖιν, afterwards contraeted with the stem and so producing
the forms ἴπποιν (dissyllable), ὀφθαλμοῖν, etc. Did this termina-
tion belong to the Indo-Europeau period? or is it entirely the
creation oi Greek? It seems very hard to give any reply to
this question, except that we do not see whence Greek could
have derived it. The most probable view is that there is a
very close relation between the oblique case of the dual and the
locative plural; for ἵπποιιν is the same as imorcer with the
regular loss of the intervocalic σ.1

3. Oblique Gasc (2) (Latin).—The forms duo-bus, ambobus
are not plurale, since there is no case in -bus in the Latin 2nd
declension. Now Sanskrit has in the duel an instrum.-dat.-ebl.
termination thyara, dvctbhydm=duebu33 hence it is probable
that the Latin -bus herois a relic of an old duel termination,
corrupted through the anelogy of the termination of the dative-
ablative plural of other declensionsfr'

Festus). It will be seen that Greek and Latin agree in adding
ap to the stem; but in this respect they diverge from the
Indo-European type, which in this declensicn as iu all the
others had the termination -ἔε, eg. *ekwcs=*ekwo-es, sk.
equuus Hence we should expect *ἷππως *equ633 but, cn the
other hand, the terminetion cy was regular in the pronomine]
declension‚ eg. Sk. te: *toy (they) ; hence it is easily conceiv-
able that phrases like τοὶ *tenue isti* equos would become τοὶ
ἵπποι, istc equi. This is not the only case in which the o-stems
have horr-owed from the pronouns. and in this particular ease
