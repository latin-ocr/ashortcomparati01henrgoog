which has no less influence in this department than in that 01
derivation.¹ For, like words, the forms 01 declension and con-
jugation classiiy themselves in our mind in series, in which
classes regarded rightly or wrongly as identioal from 1 logical
point of view constantly tend to become identified in form also;
hence a suffix which seems to be everywhere the same 10 per-
haps 00 only because at some past time it hasbeen detached
from some words and then introduced into all the rest.2
Further, if the language contains the suffix as a separate word,
it is possible that the separate word has been formed from
the suffix, instead of the suffix being a corruption of the

Let us consider this unceasing action 01 analogy in a depart·

Ι91110111. Thus theold form of the language knows only the
nom. sing. li pcre3 but little by little thes 01 the neighbour-
ing declension‚ being wrongly regarded 10 the necessary sign
01 the nom. sing, makes its way into this word also, and 00 in
the thirteenth century we find only the contaminated form 11
peres, 11111100, 11 conpeteret.
