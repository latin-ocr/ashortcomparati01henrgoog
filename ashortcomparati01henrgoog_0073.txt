the other hand, that very possibly *collegere may have become
colligere through the analogical iniluencel of the regular colligo,
as conversely the regular forms neglegere, intellegere produced
’ the presente neglego, intellego. In other cases the vocalism
of the simple verb was perhaps wrongly introduced into the
compound: thus we ought to have *repete but we have repeto
through the analogy of pete. Such attractione are very com-

rejacere (Fr. rescire) instead of reficere, acceptare (Fr.
arheter) on the model of captore, and may evidently have

sometimes altered the simple verb: thus, though the conju-
gation is different, the Latin plico certainly corresponds to the
Greek πλέκω <1p1aic); hence we must admit that the vocalism
