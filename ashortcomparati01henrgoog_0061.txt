(21) 1. Liquids.¹ We may distinguish essentially three
kinds 01 Χ8, according 88 8188 quivering obstacle which produces
it consiste 01 the upper margin 01 the glottis, the uvula, or the
tip 01 the tongue. Glottal r, unknown to the cultivated lan-

' guages of Europe, is very common in Arabic, and is heard also,
though in a very impure form, in the pronunciation 01 those
persons who have a tendeucy 80 “burring.’' The second,
uvular r, is that 01 northern Erench; in southern Erench it
18 replaced by lingual r, which is also the only kind known

⁸ in Italian and Spanish.

There are also several kinds 01 1; but this distinction is
much less important.

2. 1188818. We have seen that the nasale are 0808088088Ι
with the mouth closed. Now the place 01 0108888 may be
situated at any point whatever in the cavity 01 the mouth,
from the soft palate 80 the lips. If the tongue rests against
the 8018 palate (velum palati) or the palatal arch, the sound
is called velat or palatal rl; this is the ng 01 English and
German final syllables, often called also guttural 8. 11 the
tongue closes the mouth 88 the level 01 the sockets (alveoli)
01 the upper teeth, we hear the ordinary or alveolar 8. 11
the olosure takes place in 18088 by means 01 the joined lips,
we have the ¹labial m. ·

When used as vowels, the liquide and nasale may be long
or short, just like the ordinary vowels,

(22) 1. Explosives.² The closure 01 the mouth which
is necessary for the production 01 a voiced or voiceless ex·
plosive may likewise be velar, palatal‚ dental, or labial.
Hence four groups 01 0088088888, which include 8180 several
subordinate groups.⁸ The first two groups are 01888 united
