5. Accusative neuter: always like the nominative.

6. Ablative (1).-Admittingthat there originally existed in
this deolension an ablativo in d preceded by a vowel,¹ of which
there is no traco in Greek or Sanskrit‚ Latin, in any case, cen
only have kept it in r·- and ustems, eg. puppi =*pupptd=
*puppi-edd), and maau=rmaaud=tmaaat-ed(?). But it is
also possible that *puppod and *manau were formed simply on
the analogy of the relation between seruos and *sercod in the
2nd declension. However this may be, it is quito certain that
puppi, mand are the only true ablatives of this deolension‚
in other words that patr-e, for example, cannot go back tc
*patrea since final d is only lost after a long vowel. The
ablative in -ἔ is therefore v‘ery likely a locative ;2 it certainly
fulfils the function of the locative (alter in, aab, eta), and
has been confused with it in amanner which will be explained
subsequently. ’

The ablative has remained pure in the testems (ath decl.):
magistrata'td (S. 0. de Bacch), maort, gend, and the supinos
in -tc't,³ with the exceptiones the very rare barbarism fruteto.

The ablativo of the i-stcms, in which the final d is still
found on old inscriptions, martd, aldred, turra, acra, urrimdlt,
has not only been kept in certain words, but has even spread
beyond its proper limite. We find alred, coveutioctd, although
the stems are consonantal‚ aie· (brass), recentiore, etc, and, in
old Latin, corpore and corpori, majore and majort,prrldentb and
prudente are used indifferently, probably through the influence
of the regular dative prudent-t and the identity of the two
cases in the ind declension (servo). In classioal Latin this
, alternation is scarcely retained except by the poeta, and then
only in stems ending in crt- or an explosive (abl. felicl); but in
inscriptions it is much more common. Of course this final t
could also be written ei or e: whence the scansion Gauiood
patre prognatus (Ep. Scip.); and also probably the word
moraroann (ColRostr.) which, if not a pseudoarchaio barbarism,
must be read with the e=t‚ like ulvanm=acvatte in the
same inscription.
