tion in); lastly, genitive, which it would be more exact to
call possessive, in virtue of its essential and primitive
function.¹ Gorresponding to each of these relations there were
generally several terminatione, which have nearly all survived
in Greek and Latin, although Greek has nominally only five
cases, and Latin six.

These terminatione may be added to the stem without modi·
fying it. This is usually the case, at least in Greek and Latin,2
in the declension called parisyllabic, which hence may be
treated separately and before the other declensions, not only
because it is the most simple, but also because it has in many
points contaminated by analogy the declension called ¹impari·
syllabic,³ while the latter has had very little influence on it.
In the imparisyllabic declension, which has sometimes kept,
sometimes very capriciously modified the original vowel·¹¹
gradation of its stema, we shall have to study successively the
terminatione and the changes in the stem caused by the
addition of these terminatione. Lastly, the pronomina] de-
clension, which stands quite by itself, differs even more from
that of the nouns properly so called than the two nomina]
declensions differ from one another, and will require a separate
chapter. Such then is the division 'of our subject.

¹ Or better still “adnominalss’ since, properly speaking, it ean only be
governed by a noun ot which it completos the sense.

² In primitive Indo-European all the declensions must have been more or
less subject to vowel-gradation.

lThis terminology is uniemunately not very precise; forthere areno ·

more syllables in γένους or nous than in γένος or aete, and on the other
band there are more in θεοῖο and deorum than in θεός and deus. It has
however been thought best tc adhere to it, since it is both customary and
convenient. The important point is not to take it too literally.
