this distinction porfectly in tho -u-stems, hut in the -i-stems
the two modes of declension have been confused.

I. Stems ιἰι -u-.—1. Without gradation: ἰχθῦ-ς ἰχθῦ-ν ἰχθύ-ος,
epo-s δρυ-ός end even δρῡ-ός on analogy of nom. ; and also νέκΰς
νέκυ-ος (but the Homeric quantity νέκῦς is probably more
ancient). The contrast between the deolension oi stt-s and
manu-s in Latin has already been pointed οιιι.1

2. This contrast however is the only relic of the primitive
gradation in mauu-s, which seems no longer to have a stem
*mcueu- corresponding to the Greek alternation γλυκύ· *γλυκέιη
-Sing Nom.: πέλεκυ-ς, ἄστυ, γλυκύ-ς γλυκύ. Ace: πέλεκυν,
ἄστυ, γλυκύ-ν (γλυκέα analogicali) γλυκύ. Lon: ιι*πελέκει-ι,
whence πελέκεϊ πελέκει, ιἰίστείΙ ἄστει, γλυκέῖ γλυκεῖ. Gen: *eschinei-
ος, whence πελέκεις, ἄστεος, γλυκέος; in Att. πελέκεως, ἄστεως
(but not γλυκέως, which belongs toa much later period of
Greek) are due to the analogy of forms like cmiter-Plu.
Nom.: ιι*πελέκει-ες, whence πελέκεες πελέκεις, ἄστεα ἄστη, γλυκεῖς
γλυκέα (very rarely contracted). Aeo: regularly *πελέκῦι
ιγλυκῦς,4 but, through analogy of the other cases, Hom.
πελέκεις, γλυκέας; Αιι. πελέκεις, γλυκεῖς, through extensiones the
nominative. Loc: regularly *πελέκυ-σι, *γλυκύ-σι (Sk. evadri x
ἔω); λιιι, through extension of the stem πελεκε·, which was
supposed to appear in the other cases, πελέκεσι, ἄστεσι, γλυκέσι.
Gen: πελέκεων, ἄστεων, γλυκέων.

Π. Steucs ιἰι -i-.—According to what we have just seen, a
stem 1λπόλῑ- (town, cf. πολῐπη-ς)ὅ would become in the gen.
*πολῖγ-ος, whence πόλιος, whereas a stem πόλι· would become
*πόλει-ος, whence πόλεος; λιιι πόλι-ς and similar words gener·
ally show both modes of declension, according to the dialect.-
Sing. Nom.: πόλι-ς, φύσι-ς. Ace: πόλι-ν, φύσι-ν. Lea: Hom.
and Now Ion. πόλῖε*πόλιι; Hom. πόληΐ, in which the long
vowel seems to arise from a very old locutive form attested by

¹ Supra 204, 4 note, 6 note, etc.

² Supra 204, 4.

⁸ Thus approximately πελέκεως ι πελέκεωνειππέωι ι ἱππέων. The arcent
irregularly drawn back ιιι πελέκεων clearly shows ιλιι πελέκεων and πελέκεως

l od a reciprocal influence on one another.
⁴ Sapra 206, 3.

⁵ We find in Homer πόλῖς (Ιλ xvi. 69) and πόλῑν (Il. xvi. 57).
