II. 1101110111 ·on-‚ mon·.—In the declension of the stem ·
κύων, 00 01 *1ρήν, the weak form prevails: nom. sing. xdo11;
acc. κόν-α 101 *κύον-α, through the analogy 01 the weak oases;
100.κυν·ί; gen. κυν·ός; nom. pl. miv-ts for *acrior-m aec. 11111-αῆ
gen. κυνῶν; loc. 11111110 φρεσί, etc.2

Latin has an exact counterpart 10 κύων in car-0, stem. carco-3
nom. sing. carm 000. caru-em instead 01 1001011-011101 *careu-
rm on account of the weak cases, dat. cora-t, gen. 00111-10;
nom. pl. cara-es, etc. The reduction is not carried so far, but is
still quite plain in: nom. sing. hom-63 acc. hemon-em 01 rather
hemon-em (arch),3 either regular or corrupted from the regular
*deoida-em through intrusion 01 the long vowel of the nomina-
tive, afterwards superseded by 11011111-0111 01 the analogy of
the following forms, dat. homin-t=*homco-t or *tempu-t 3
gen. 10111111-10; nom, pl. homiaea, etc. There perhaps existed
a form with complete reduction, 111101111110, which, being pro-
ncunced and written omues, and meaning successively “ men,
all men, all,’' led to the creation by analogy of the nom. sing.
01111110 (Breal).

This type of gradation was lost in Greek. Latin kept and
even extended it, applying it 10 0 large number 01 010110
in -011-, chiefly feminines, 11111911, cripe, ferruge, 0111101111ᾱά1,
011 even 10 words borrowed from Greek,4 Apelle, arch. gen.
Apoloa-es, whereas the ordinary and classical deciension is
Apollinem Apellae-ie.

Except in the case 01 κύων, Greek extended to the whole
declensicn the form -ον-, pov-2 ἡγεμών, ἡγεμόν-ος, 010.; 100. pl.
ἡγεμό-σι 101 *ἡγεμά-σιε*ἁγεμ1,1-σί. Latin has nothing parallel
1011110, But, like Greek, it has a large ¹number of stems still
further corrupted, which have generalized the long vowel 01

¹ Pectiair however perhaps has the reduced grado, since it may go back
’ 10 11111111101101 as well as to *portenta We have already seen the pos-
sibility of the declension *selec *sela-ia (gall), cupra 113.

2 Thus ruci: κυνὶτφρεσίτ φρενί; 111101 *ruach which would have be·
0011011111.

³ Vulturna 111 siluas miserum subridebat leonianam (Eum).

⁴ This shows the remarkable vitality of this form of deolension.
