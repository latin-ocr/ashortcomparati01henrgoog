indifferently σχολαίτερα 01 σχολαιτέρως, 010.) used as positivae,
levi-ter, licenter=*liteat-ter‚ audac-ter, salte-iter (1111101010-
, gical a· as in felic-ihm, infra 206, 5), firmiter, and so in
old Latin many adverbs derived from adjectives of the 2nd
1001010101(111]1011)110111001), which disappeared in classical
Latin, being superseded by the adverbial ablativos in -0,

(160) XIV. Sufflcc -nt·: forms in Greek and Latin the
participles corresponding 10 all the thematic forms of verbe,
φέρ-ο-ντ-4 (nom. φέρων), λαβ-ό-ντ-, λύ-σ-ο-ντ-, cte, fer-emt· (nom.
fereae), amane, 010. 11 will be noticed that the thematic
vowel is always ο in Greek and ein Latin¹

(161) XV. Suffioe-es-.—This suffix is scarcely ever secandary
, in Greek except in those adjectivae in -έσ-, whose formation is
uot original, 09. καναχ-ής (noisy, from καναχή), limparis (“ stick-
ing ’' to a thing, eamest), contrasted with λιπ-α-ρό-ς (oily). It is
so indirectly in Latin, through the introduction into all verbs
of the infinitivus in 10 and 11, of which we have already seen
the nominal origin 1111111100111111,2 01111110 01110111, audire 01111101,
and through the analogical creation of the perfect infinitivam
scisse (modelled on esse), 01101010, amovisse, 010. The archaia
type 0111101101, audacter remains obscure.

XVI. Suffioe -ios-,-Very rarely secundary in Greek (cy.
χερείων, worse,=*)(cpec·icv) 3 but in Latin it forms the com-
parative of all adjectives without distinction: doc-t-ior,
sor-tior, sapie-otior, benefice-atior (from 1110 obsoleto *becc-
ficcce‚ but used as comparative of beneytcue). We know how·
ever that custom denies a comparative 10 adjectives in -110, -10
and some others less important.

(162) XVII. Suffiec -k6·.-Very common; in Greek it invari-
ahly has the accent, φοσι-κό-ς, μαν-τι-κό-ς. From this common
type has been formed a 1111111116, which has become widely dis-
seminatcd‚ >toy-tude, ἅστ-ικό-ς (urban), &perd-r (ripe), deppae-tuda
(cutaneous)‚ and from the last type again has arisen a suffix
-τικό·, which appears in numerous complex formatione like
ε’κ-κλη-σι·α-σ-τικό-ς. Another suffix equally common, -ιακά, ag.
πελοποννησ-ιακός must have come originally from the com-
bination 01 the suffix -κό- with feminine primary stems in aa·
