w is a vowel, ey. primitively *tri and *tot which may be seen
respectively in the Doric τύ (τῦ) and Lat. tu (cf. Hom. τῡνη,
Il. xix. 10). In the ether cases there is an alternation between
the forms *lewes *tcw-, *teoc- end *tco-. In Dorio and Latin
the w after the t is simply dropped. But, in the other Greek
dialects, the greup af becomes o, ay. acc. ot=rf63 then, the
initial σ spreading throughout the whole declensien, Lesbian,
Ionio, Attio and the κοινή have in the nom. sing. σύ instead of
the regular Dorio τύ (Boeet. τούετῦ).

2. The stem *yu-, with the addition *·sm·, characteris-es the
plural in Greek as in Sanskrit (abl. yutmdt, like cemdt in the
lst pers.): Lesb. ὔμμες fer *lippae Der. ὑμές (long t), ete.

3. Stem *we- (ef. Sk. acc. pl. ves): in the Latin plural.

4. Stem *cdo-(ik in the Greek duel, with no parallel else-
where; oi' unknown origin, like the stem *ode of the 3rd person.

(224) 111. In the ard person, two stema, *aare and *σφέ-
(in Greek alone), but only the former is primitive. It is quite
certain, indeed, and Latin alone is a sufficient guarantee cf the
fact,¹ that the stem *aare served both for the singular and plural.
Further, the pronoun *sere does net, strictly speaking, belong
to the 3rd person; it is the reflexive proneun for all persons and
numbers.2 From the point ef view oi Inde-European syntax
phrases like eye se geram (I shall behave mysely‘), ces sibi
placetis (you plesse pertractares), amisimus suam metram (wc
have lest ecc mother), quia siae rivoli seque et sua'selus noceres,
ete, would be quite correct, and we still find corresponding
usages at the present day in the Slavenic languages. In Latin,
this proneun remained strictly reflexive, hut in its use was
restricted to the 3rd person. In Greek the corruption went
much farther; the prenoun ἔ· was used, either as reflexive, or
as a simple pronoun of the 3rd persen, and we knew that
Homeric usage is invariable in this respect. Hence it was felt
necessary to create a plural fer it, and the stem *σφέ-, the origin
of which is very obscure,³ was called upon to fulfil this function.

¹ Its evidence is likewise confirmed by that ei Sensktit Teutonic, and
Slavcni03 oi. Germ. aie icrea rich (they deceive themselves).

² This accounts ier the iact that it hus nc nominative.
