Tul-lue and Tul-l-iu-e, rer-vce and Ser-odere, eom-oue and
eom-mum, etc. The Latin termination -aeaoe is of course
,borrowed

2. Final -i-.-In Greek, the suffix -yo- added to the suffix
are, ep. θυ-σί-ῖι (secundariae-ys, produced the suffix -σια,
which became very common: daupi-otor (wonderful), depe-oros
(popular), εὐεργ-εσίᾶ (kindness). In Latin, the very common
suffix -tio- must have the same origin: nupti-oe, servitio-m,
amic-iiim then, through the intimate relation between the
two suffixos -e'd and -i,¹ the doublets avaritia avarities, eto.

3. Final -o-.-Gk. νέκ-υ-ίᾶ and νέκ-υ-ιᾶ (calling up of the dead)
from νέκ-υ-ς, etc. But adjectives in ui take the form -r‘i- before
the secondary suffix -ῑ- (Gk. aa) of the feminine gender:
ἡδύ-ς &sindili-rh, like gen. abradote-022 Stems in -eir
naturally follow the same rule, dorth-eds βασίλειος (royal)=
*βασίλ-εΡ-ιας, γραφεύς γραφεῖον (stylus for writing): whence
the suffix -ειο- -εἳο-, extended to forms like παρθένειος (maidenly)‚
’γυναικεῖον (women’s quarters).

4. Final -ee- (ost—The perfect participle in -Ὲόσ- reduces
its suffix before the secondary suffix -rd=t of the feminine:
‹fortudinem-rt. In the other formatione the primary suffix
remains unchanged: Ἀργεῖοςε*Ἀργ-έσ-ιας from Ἄργος, ἀλήθεια
ε*ἀ-λᾶθ-εσ-ιᾶ and Ion. hludowii-lodewici, αἰδοῖος (venerable)
:mildo-roe, etc.; whence a fresh source for suffixos -εῖο- and
-οῖα, Latin has in this class the forms plebe-ires plebe-jue,
with the same lengthening as in plebes, vener-irre from Van-us·
(Vener-is), and Houor-ius with the same lengthening as in the
gen. horr-oris, ci. Gk. *aldio-or.

5. Final nosci-Primary snffix reduced before gd: θεράπ-ων
(servant), fem. θεράπαιναε*θεράπ-ῃ-μα, whence the fem. suffix
-αινα extended to θέ-αινα (goddess), etc. The same reduced
before -io-: ποι-μήν (shepherd), roi-pv-ror (sheepfold). The

same without any reduction or change: τέρ-ην (aeft), fem. τέρεινα
:liriaco-yffi τέρμ-ων (boundary)‚ τερ·μόν-ια-ς (extreme). In
Latin, with the lengthening already noticed‚ querimur-ia
(complaint)‚ matri-monium, etc.
