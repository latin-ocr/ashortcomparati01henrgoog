par-tien, adv), and with a secondary suffix in nouns in -tie,i
The group στ however remains unohanged, ep. ε’σ-σί (he is),
πίσ-τι-ς (faith)=*m'd·ra-s, of. πείθ-ω. The numerous cases in
Ionio-Attio in which τ has not been assibilated before tmay
generally be attributed to the disturbing influenoe of analogy.²

2. I.-E. tt cannot be restored with any certainty except in
the suffix of the second pere. sing. of the perfect: Sk. vet-tha
(thou knowest)‚ hence I.-E. *wopa-tta, corresponding to which
Greek has θ and Latin (much corrupted however) a simple t:
fcio-do vid-isdi- ⁷

3. I.·E. d=Gk. 8=Lat. d. To the examples already given
(δόμος domus, δύσωρ datter, οἶδα vtdt¹ etc.) may be added δεξιά-ς
and den-ter, δόλ-ος (triok) and dolet-s (seduto=*ae doto, with·
out fraud), ῖδίωεσῆδίω and sodo, of. Germ. schacitzea [Eng.
swect]‚ dpadds=ppdda sk. mpdcts, and mollia=*mold-v-i-8, cf.
ἡδύς and suevia. We see from the last instance that Lat. td
becomes u. The same is the case with Lat. dl: aella (chair)
ἐκφύοι, cf. sect-ee and ἕδος. Sometimes a simple d appears
under the form l in Latin, which must be due to amixture
of dialecte: toccu-mu, arch. dcccdccc, Gk. δύκρυ; olen, odom
liupua=*diapua=l.·E. *dpptwe‚ cf. Eng. tonpae, Germ.
σύνορα aotam, ἔδαφος (soil), and cea-sutas (those who sit
together), ecc-sul ( :qui eontra sedet), etc. Greek does not seem
to be exempt from this change3 for the borrowed word Ulysses
perhaps eomes from some Dorio dialect of Magna Graecia in
which Ὀδυσσεύς was pronounced 1“*Ὀ>οσσσής.3

4. Ι.-Ε. dh=Gk e=Lat f initially. When mediat, prae-
Italic f, which is kept in other dialects, cannot remain in
Latin; when arising from I.-E. dh, it generally becomes simple
d3 but after u or v, before l, and before or after r, it becomes
b, in the same way as f arising from bh (infra).

¹ Notice that this suffix in its turn has been assibilated in the Romanoa

lunguages. . ,

2 For example, in deciension‚ when τ was not followed by ι, it remained.
Hence the proper declenaion would be φύσις ’φύσεοςε*φύ-τεύ-ος; but the
analogy oi φύσις produced φύσεος φύσεως. On the other hand, the anulogy
oi φάτεος restored the forms φύσις, μῆτις, eto. So also the Greek looatives
φέροντι, ὀνόματι, eto, are to be explained by the analogy oi φέροντα, ὀνόματος.

³ Ὀλυττεύς is found in an insumption on an Attio vase; still it is possible
that the corruption Ulparea is oi purely Latin origin.
