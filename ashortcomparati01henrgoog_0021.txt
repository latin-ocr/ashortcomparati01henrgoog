Who would have told me, at the time when I was writing
these pagos, that my dear master and friend, Abel Bergaigne,
would not see the second edition of a work which his wishes
had called forth and his kind influenee had befriended? Such
assit is, since he was so indulgent as to deem it worthy oi him,
Isdedicate it to his deerly loved memory, which will be reli-
g‘iously treasured by all those who have had the happiness of
knowing him. He was one of those men whose mind and heart
'are so noble, that, even at the eost of the bitter paug of separa·
tion, we can never cease to rejoioe at having met them on our
Ῑ liie’s pathway.
¹ This second edition does not differ materially from the first.

. I have corrected some mistakes, filled up some gaps, and cleared

Ι up some obscurities, which the kindness of eolleagues has
pointed out to me. In this respect I owe especial thanks to

MM. F. de Saussure and L. Job. I have put the bibliography
aud the text on a level with the works published in 1888, and I
believe that I have left nothing undone in order to continue to

deservo the favour which has greeted tho publication of this
unassumiug manual. To those who have thus honoured me, and

· especially Professors Brdul, De Harlez, Hubschmann, Merlo,2

G. Meyer, Sayce, and my friend M. H. Wiukler, I wish to
express my sincere gratitudo.

entered, while still young, into eternal rest. Like Bergaigne, and only tvo
months aiter him, he met his death during an Alpina excursiou.
