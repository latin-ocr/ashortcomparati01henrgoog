carefully distinguish the sentence-accent, which is independent
of the former. A word usually enclitic or proclitic may some-
times be emphasiaed by the speaker,1 or, on the other hand, a
word usually important may be almost lost in speaking.2 It
must be obvious to everybody that the close cl an interrogative
sentence is spoken in a higher pitch than that of an affirmative
sentence, and that the same word assumes a perceptibly differ-
ent intonation according as it occurs in the middle or the end
cf a sentence. In the latter case, the substitution of the grave
for the acute accent in Greek in cxytone words occurring in
the middle of a sentence is, together with the absence of accent
in enclitics, the only attempt made to represent in writing the
sentence-accent, the study of which moreover belongs rather to
the province of rhythm than of phonetics

We have no detailed knowledge of Indo-European accentua-
tion, because it was greatly corrupted in the derived languages.
Sanskrit accentuation however, which probably reproduces it
with considerable exactness, enables us to infer that it was
at once frear and more changeable than that of Greek and
Latin: frear, for the acoent could rest on any syllable whatever
of a word, even the sixth from the end, asin Sk. dmanyamduesu
(among those who do not worship) ; more changeable, for in the
same word it might, according to fixed laws, rest now on one
syllable, now on another, Sk. ddypat (ἔδρακε, he saw) and dyrpdt,
where the augment, being unaccented, was dropped.

(81) One main principle underlies the whole of Greek and
Latin accentuation: the accent in any word cannot go further
back than the last syllable but two. In Greek alone a long
final syllable is reckoned as two syllables.³
