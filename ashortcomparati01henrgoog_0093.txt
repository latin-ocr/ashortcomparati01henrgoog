11111111. ser-cns (the final a is not original, infra). This
Greek or Latin a is liable to the following modificatione:

A.—The group lais assimilatod 10 ll: Gk. ὄλλῦμι (Ι destroy) ,
&dh-virae, ef. the verbs in -νῦ·; Lesb. βόλλομαι (Ι wish)=
11βόλ-ν1-μοιι;1 Lat. cottis=*ooto·io, 01. κολωνός, and probably
peccamen, 01. the verbs in no. In Ionio-Attio compensa·
tory lengthening is usually substituted for λλ, ay. βούλομαι.

B.—The pronunciation 01 the group 01· develops between the
two consonante a transitional ground, which Greek denotes by
d: ἀν-ήρ, gen. *civ-ode, whence ἀνδρός; 01. in French 9011011·οε
*ρέπνόερέηθωτηβ and infra μβρ from μρ. At a later period,
νρ was assimilated to ρρ and νλ 10 mmeramme-pem,
συλλέγω = 1συν-λέγω. So also in Latin 1111ιό, 1111131118.

G-The group formed by a nasal ÷s rarely remains3 its
treatment is somewhat complicated.

(α) When this group is proethnio and medial, the a dis· ·
appears in Greek, and the preceding nasal is doubled3 then
this reduplication, which remains in Lesbian, is superseded in
the other dialeots bya compensatory lengthening of the pre-
ceding vowel: Lesb. ἔκτεννα, Ion. ἔκτεινα (eor. of meivw)=
*ἔ-κτεν-σ·α, and sc also ἔμεινα from μένω, ἔνειμα-41101100 from
νέμω, ἕφηναε ἔφᾱνατ *dcere-o from φαίνω, besides the' aorists,
χήν (goose), 801.χην-όςε*χᾶνσ-ός, 01. Sk. hamana (swan), and
Lat. 11111101 dasem ὦμος (0110111101)ε*ὄμσος, 01. Sk. docear,
Umbr. casus, and Lat. amoma: *omeaoa eto.

(β) 11 the group is proethnio and final, or if 11- has arisen ¹
exclusively in Greek, it remains in Gretan andArgive, in which
dialeets we find τόνς (aee. pl), πάνσα(10111.,Α11. πᾶσα) ; in all
other dialeots, if the preceding vowel is short, the ν disappears

· with compensatory lengthening of the preceding vowel. In

this 0000,ι11(1 υ always become land ὑ, but ἄ,ε,01(10 give
respectively, in Lesbian αι, ει (diphthong)‚ οι, in Doric ἃ, η, ω, in
Ionio-Attio ᾶ, ει (vowel), ου (vowel). Ep. acc. pl. *πόλι-ν-ς,
*ἰχθύ-νς, then πόλῐς (Herodotus), ἰχθῦς, τόνς volva, whence (AEol.)
τωίς ταῖς, (Dor.) τώς τᾶς, (Ion-All.) τούς τάς, fem, *adra-yn,

¹ ef. Homeric βόλεται (11. xi. 319), βόλεσθε (od. xvi. 3871.
