nation of -εσι end -εσσι led to the doubling of the σ in πολέσσι,
νέκυσσιν, etc. Α

A 'barbarism which is very rare in literature, but very
common in inscriptions, consists in the transference to this
declension of the terminations -οισι -οις belonging to ths loc.
and dut. of the 2nd decll: πάντ-οις, dripere, ἄγώνοις, ιιι,
ὄσσοισι (in the eyes) and ὄσσοις (cf. nom. dual ὄσσε) in Hesiod
end Sappho, etc.

7. Genitive.—The primitive termination was ilem, end there
is nothing ιο hinder us from believing that Latin accurately
reproduoes it inite ending um: coum, avi-um, mauu-um
(contracted currum), ped-um, ferent-um, homin-um, potr-um,

'gener-um, etc. On tho other hand the long vowel in Greek
shows, here us in the oblique cese of the dual, the introduction
of the ending of the 2nd decl, πόλε·ων, ἥδέ-ων, ἰχθύ-ων, uod-dv,
φερόντ·ων, Ικυιι-ῶν, πατέρ-ων, τειχέων,’θιο.

In Latin, the analogy of the i-stems had a great influenoe
on this case, and led to the substitution for -um of a termina-
tion -c'um, in a few mouns, urb-ium? arc-ium, but especially
in those adjectives which take -iu in the nom. pl. nent, '
cordo-ium, felic-ium, uictricium, ferent-ium, prudent-ium,
etc. In the last class of words the genitive in -um survived‚
chiefly in the poetS, and the constant coexistence side by side

. of the two forms sapientium and sapientum even led to the

suppression of the ι’ in some genitivos which ought to have
contained it, cauum, opum (of bees), ιφἰιοοιιιιιιι, etc*

Ἴ VARIATIONS OF 'er STEM IN DEOLENSION.

(207) The variations of the stem in declension depend on
uvowelgradation, which is sometimes very clear, sometimes
hardly perceptible or even entirely lost ; this gradation usually
