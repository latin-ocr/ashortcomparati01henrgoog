becomes sr12diyor=*cpiyor‚ Lat. frey-ue. The other groups
are assimilated respectively to ll, mm, au, which at the be-
ginning of a word naturally become l, m, and a; hut in the
Homerio poems the metre often compels us to restore the
etymological reduplication. Ep. Lat. lubricet-s (slippery), ci.

4. Before a consonant initial s remains anchanged: Gk.
' στόρ-νῦ-μι, σπείρω, σβέννῦμι; Lat. scande, sto, spere, etc. Some·
times however in Greek, ey. τέγος (eovering) τέγω (to cover)
by the side of στέγος στέγω (sk. athap), and very often in Latin,
the initial consonant can be proved to have fallen away: cao-eo
(to beware), cf. Germ. schamen (to look at attentivcly) [Eng.
show]‚ hence torneae-em repo, toga, tepula (tile), ef. στέγω;
sallo, cf. σφάλλω (to throw down), and sk. aphet-deni (to
throw). These apparent exceptions are generally regarded as
syntactical doublets.²

§Z Medial S.

(69) 1. Between vowels. Before the historic period of

- Greeh,³ intervocalic s, like initial s, passed into h, and then
' disappeared without leaving any trace of its existence. In
Latin intervocalic s is still found in some of the oldest remains,

ap. Lnsns=Lares (Oarm. Arv.); hut at this period it was no . τ

longer pronounced as s, it had already passed into the sound
of z, as is shown by Oscan transcriptione, such as egenarum

· ¹ The intermediate stage is thr (Eng. th) 3 ct. supra 66.

'² In a phrase lihe eorpus arma 'crepent the swas pronounced‚ but in pro-
nouneing arma eorpus *etegent the two s’s became one ; hence the mistaken
idea that there was a word *tepent which was afterwards transferred to other

hrases also.
p ⁸ We must therefore bevere oi restoring, in an Homeric form for example,
an initial or intervoealie σ.
