a)

When a syllable capable of gradation is supported by
an c, it may, and indeed often does happen, that this vowel is
accompanied by a nasal or liquid, γέν-ος, pand-6. In 11113 3333
the syllable can be deflected without difficulty3 reduction will
be equally easy, if the resulting group of consonante finds
a vowel to support it in the neighbouring syllable; we have
already seen γέρον-α and γί-γν-ομαι. Β111 what will happen ir
the 113331 31 liquid is shut in between two consonante, ‘thus
forming an unpronounceable group without a vowel? The

answer is'forced upon us: it must itself become a vowel in ’

orderto support the neighbouringoonsonants: in other words,
just as in' λείπω ἔλιπον, φεύγω ἔφυγον, the semi-vowelsrt and υ
become vocalized when they cease to be supported by the ε,
eo also to an LE. present *derb-o (I see) there must have
necessarily corresponded 311 331131 *odylo-dm (Gk. δέρκ-ομαι
ἔ-δρακ-ον), and the gradation of the perfect *wcyd-ct *wid-mes
’ ζ Gk. iotha ft'dpevlirresistibly calls fora parallel gradation ,
*pe-pono pez-paones (Gk. γέ-γον-ιι γέρα-μεν).

Sanskrit alone has preserved the vocalia ρ’, the last relic of
the primitive vocalism3 corresponding to ἔδρακον, it has ddypom,
to πατράσι pitseo. But, even apart from this valuable evidence,
the analogy of the 1331 of the declension, πατέρα, πατρός, etc,
would by itself be sufficient 13 enable us to recognise in πρά 31
πατράσι the same vocalia degree as in πρ ol πατρί, merely modified
by the accidental fact that in πα-τρί the ι· is supported by the

t, whereas in 1’πα-τρὶσι thetis forced to rest for support on
