few words where it was needed, in order to distinguish the

6. coactiva-111 Latin the locative was superseded by the
dat-abl. In Greek it ought to be *χώρᾰ-συ; but we have
already seen¹ the regular substitutiones -σιν for -crv,² whence
the type δραχμῇ-σι, χώρᾶ-σιν, which serves at once as a locative,
dative, ablativo and instrumental in Homer and Herodotus, and
which has been preserved in classical Greek only in the type
Ἀθήνησι, Πλαταιᾶσιν, with a strictly locative function. The
analogy of the termination -οισι of the 2nd declension caused
the addition of an ι subscript, κεφαλῇσιν, a spelling which is
almost invariable in manuscripts, but not in inscriptions.
Another termination -αισι (Old Attio), more directly modelled
on -οισι, seems to have only spread very slightly.

7. (lanitium—This case has horrowed its termination *eom
from the pronomina] declension: sk. tat-samberrem, Gk.
rdv=*vd-cov; whence Gk. χωρᾶ·ωνε*χωρᾰ-σων, Ost. epula-zum
(rerum), Lat. terrorum=*terr·ct-sum. The well known form
χωράων is AEolic and Homeric; it is contracted in Dorio, χωρᾶν;
in Ionio it of course becomes *yoptoa whence χωρέων; it is
contracted in Attio, χωρῶν. The perispomenon 'is the rule,
except in adjectivae like φίλω-ς, where the gen. pl. fem. has
yielded to the analogy of the masa-naut, whence φίλων instead
of *φιλῶνβ probably because oxytones like καλό-ς necessarily
had the same accentuation in all three gunders, καλῶν. In
Latin, the syncope apriculum, indicentem, which occurs only
in poetry and in masculine compounds‚ is an artificial imitation
of that which was wrongly supposed to occur in the gen pl. of
the hnd declension deum=deorum.⁴

ξ 2. Masculice.

(196) In Latin the inflexion of the masculinos presents no
peculiarity: scriba, apricolu, parricida, are declined like

¹ Low Latin aquatus, auimatum, eto.

³ This assimilation was not universal ·, the κοινή accented χῖλίων δραχμῶν,
but pure attic χῑλιῶν δραχμῶν. ⁴ Supra lea. 7.
