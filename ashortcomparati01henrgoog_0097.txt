2. Βίεεὶπι,ἱΙαῐίοῃ.-Ι11 both languages, hut especially in
Latin, there is a marked tendenoy to interchange rand l, in
order to prevent two syllables containing the same liquid from
following one another3 eg. saeclum andsolcrum, cereolis and
popularia (of. however foliolis), coeruleos=*oaeloleos, cf. coel-
um3 and ,even at a distance of two syllables apert, militaris, etc.
