Greek in the plural aleo, Lesb. ἅμμος, ὕμμος, σφός, Dor. ἁμάς,
ὖμός, adde (σφεός).

The only form whioh seems irregular is the Latin vocative
ol' the possessive pronoun of the impersonari. This ought
probably to be regarded aethe arohaio genitive of the eorre-
sponding prononn‚¹ which, in the eommon expression fili nats,
assimilated ite termination to that oi the word which aeeom·
panied it.

In the plural, as there was not originally any pronoun of the
3rd person, the other two formed a pair. This explains the

other mode of forming derivativae, by means oi the suffix ’

'‘l-tere, the regular funetion oi whiehrwe have already seen :2
Gk. (Lesb.) ‹impietae-s, (Dor.) ἇμέτερψς, ὑμέ-τερο-ς, (Hom, Ion„
Att.) ἡμέτερος, ὑμέτερος, Lat. noeter, oea-ter. Analogy afterwards
created in Greek a possessive of the 3rd person, σφέτερος, and
those oi the duel, νωΐτερος, adelviam and the external re-
semblance between σφέτερος and σφωΐτερος sometimes eaused
the latter to be used for the dnal of the 3rd person, and the
former for the plural of the and, as in the second verse of the

Ἔργα καὶ Ἡμέραι.
