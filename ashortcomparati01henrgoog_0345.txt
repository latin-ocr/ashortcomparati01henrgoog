κεκτὲωμαιε”κεκτήωμαι, and 80 also μεμνῶμαι, κεκλῶμαι; usually
a periphrasis, λελεγμένας ὧ, in Latin fectus ero (future-perfect), ι
and in funotion lectus aim. ·

§3- Optotfve.

‘sehin-v, *λπλιπίη-ν, end there are a few instenoes of it in ι
Homer, forafpv=*ot·‹rrd·fp·v, τετλαίην, τεθναίην. But the suh
junctive λελυίπω λελύκυ hes ite equivalent in the ordinary optative
λελοίποιμι λελύκοιμι.

The formation εἰδείην (dieder-(pv) εἰδεῖμεν is unique,¹
whereas its Latin equivalent viderem viderimus (called perfect i
subjunctive) hasbeen extended indefinitely. ·.

λελεγμένος ofyr, Lat. lectus eim.

§k Imperafioe.

(295) I. Aetive.—The perfect imperative is extremely rare;
in Homer, however, we find a few very regular examples of it, ,
always with the root weekened before the terminatione, δείδιθι ²
which should be eorreoted to fffftdr=lhfdhdi (sear)‚2 κέκλῖθι ’
(hear), ἕσταθι (stand), and we may eorreot πέπεισθε (AEsoh. Eum.
599) to πέπισθι (believe), on the model of the Panhellenio and
elassioal ἴσθι (know). The short vowel is also found in two
forms with metathesis, πέπλᾶθι, πέθνᾶθι. But this is all.³ Late
Greek formed, on the model of λελύκυ and λελύκοιμι, a thematis
imperative λέλυκε, not found in good Greek, and, if necessary, it
oould always heve reoourse to the periphrasis λελυκὼς ἴσθι.

ΙΙ. Middle: λέλυσο, λέλειψο, ete, with the vooalism of the
indicative, and with no gradation.
