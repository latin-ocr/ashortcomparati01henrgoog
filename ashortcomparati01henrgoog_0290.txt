in Homer μίν, in the tragio poets νίν (even in the plural); the
origin of this initial nasal has not yet been clearly explained.l
'Phe vowel of the termination is generally short; Theocritus,
however, always has the scansion ἐμῐν and τῐν, and we shall see
that the corresponding forms of the plural show the same
alternation.

8. The forms ἐμεῖο, eta, go bac-k quite naturally to *ἐμέομοε
Hora ἐμεῖο, ἐμέο, New Ion. and New Dor. ἐμεῦ, New Dor. and ,
Att. ἐμοῦ. (enolitio μεῦ μοῦ), eto.2 ·

gasmait, just like mdt, root in the abl. sing. But already in
Sanskrit, and perhaps even in the Indo-European period, the
