law only holds good in Greek for three forms (in Sanslrrit only .

101 two).

(260) Ι. &requieta-l. The termination is -μᾱν (Lesb, Dor),
whence Ion-Att. -μην,01111 is still unexplained: ἕ-δό·μηιι,ἐ’τιθέ-
μην, helpen, φεροί·μην, ἐφερό-μην, ἐλιπό-μην, 010, it is added in
the sigmatic aorist 10 the false stem in ·a·: ἐ1ῦσά-μην.

2. The termination is -oo=Zend -ha=Lat. -re 1: 1800311800
:lli-dcco, ἔθου, δοῖ-0, φέροι-ο, despondi-pipere, ἐλύσωεῆ-
λῦσο-σο, 610. In the impf. ἔδίδοσο, ἐτίθεσο, ἔδείκνυσο, etc. (but
ἐδύνω,111011001111101),1110 termination- -σο has been restored on
the anelogy 01 the cases in which the σ could not be dropped,
e 9. pl.up {lithardo and ο1.ε’λε’λυσο.

3. Gk. -το, Sk. da: ἕ-θε- -το, {dido-ro, διδοῖπο (accentuation
modified on analogy of δηλοῖτο), φέροι-το, ἐφέρετο, &loica-re,
&hilo-ro, eto.

(261) II. Darat—1. The ending -μεθον, which is in no way
primitive, is a mere hybrid form, based on the ending 01 the lst
plur. -μεθα and that 01 the and dual -σθον, It is scarcely met
with in texts, and in any case it never belonged to ordinary
speech, in which the plural was used ior the dual, as in the
active voice. Perhaps it is a mere analogical invention 01 the
grammarians E 9 περιδώμεθον (?)Il. xxiii. 485, which, how-
ever, is a primary form

2, 3, respec tively -σθον, -σθην, which are liable 10 be confused,
like -τον and -την in the active: evidently ,due to a combination
01 the dual form os the active with that 01 the 2nd plur.
middle.2

(262) III. Plural.—1. Greek has two terminatione, -μεθα and
-μεσθα, but the latter, which is rather common in Homer and

the poete generally, never appears in prose. indeed, it seems =

to belong exclusively to the Homerio dialect, the poets having
borrowed 11101 metrical reasons'.³ 'Phe form ·μεθα (01. Sk.
11111111) is certainly the only primitive form; but the other,

³ Έδόμεθα, 101 example, cannot he used in a dactylio verse, and scarcely
in an iambic or troohaie mette.
