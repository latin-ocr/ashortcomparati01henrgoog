whence *σάνσσα (cupra 39 (i δ), πάνσα, Lesb. παῖσα, Dan-Ion.-
Att. πᾶσα, and so also ἱστᾶσα, τιθεῖσα, λυθεῖσα, διδοῦσα, δεικνῦσα,
etc. When the group νς is itself followed by a consonant, the
ν disappears without lengthening3 ay. Ἀθήνᾶζε (towards Athens)
= *Ἀθήνᾶνσ-δεε hence the forms of the acc. pl. in osfernus, τὸς
θεός, and the syntactioal doublets of the proposition ε’νς (into),
ak αὐτό and ἐς τοῦτο.1

(γ) The group ns in Latin, when medial, remains, except
before l, in which case it disappears entirely with compen·
satory lengthening: scala (ladder)=*scduslc=*scciud-slo, of.
sadud-0 and trimatu eloco. If it is final, a always dis-
appears with compensatory lengtheuing: acc. pl. terras:
*terro-ns, equcsdcqudns, maaos=*maacos, etc.2 The al·
most absolute validity of this lewis of itself enough to show
that the type ferens must be a late formation.

(δ) It is sometimes said thata final u has been dropped iu
teme, home, carc, as contrasted with λειμών, κύων, etc. But, on
the contrary, it is‘rather the type homo which faithfully repre·
sente the old Indo-European nominative, vthe type λειμών, if
not an old syntactioal doublet, owes its ν to the analogy of the
oblique cases.
