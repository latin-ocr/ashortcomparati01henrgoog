quite plain that an Ionio-Attio infinitiva like ἱέναι (to go) cannot
go back to ἴμεναι, the loss of an intervocalic μ being unpro-
cedented. But we are at liberty to suppose before the suffix
the existence of a consonant the loss of which was inevitable‚
ep. t, and to restore *t-fe‘v-a. This restoration is supported
also by one or two Sanskrit infinitivus in -oaae and by the
infinitivo dcliv-m (to give, contracted in Ion-Att. to δοῦναι),
which is believed to occur on a Cypriam inscription. If, on

· the other hand, we also take into consideration the fact that the

infinitives of thematic forms, λείπειν, λιπεῖν, may likewise go
back to *teir-cieo, *lm-fta} wo see that the two hypothetioal
terminatione -Έεναι and feo bear exactly the same relation to one
another as -μεν-αι and -μεν, the one representing the dative, the
other the locative of a stem in -feva

The suffix -Ὲεν-αι was not kept unchanged; the f having dis-
appeared and the ε having been contracted with the final vowel
of the root, the Greeks no longer saw in δοῦναι, στῆναι, any
termination except -ναι, which they took for the sign of the
infinitiv032 hence it was introduced by analogy into εἵ-ναι,
redi-vm, dudd-vot, etc.

IV. Stoma with suffice -σθ-,3 used only in the dative, -σθ-αι,
as passive infinitivesz θέ-σθαι, dedo-ndat, etc.

(131) V. Stoma with suffla are-Most of these are oxy·
tone and feminine, ποθ-ὠ (persuasion), ἠχ-ώ (sound)‚ Λητ-ιίι
(Latona); masc. and paroxytone‚ tipo-s. The acc. ipae,
Λήτ-οα, in which the final m is treated as avowel‚ undoubtedly
shows the presence of a lost consonant between the o and ”0²3
if we may judge from the other form of the accusative, Ion.
Λητοῦν, this consonant may have been t, but it may also have
been y, as is indicated hy the voc. Λητοῖ and the evidence of the
grammarians‚ who recommend in the nom. the spelling Λητῴ.
Hence two distinct suffixos, ot· and -oy-, have been confused in
this formation.

VI. Status with suffla -ηύ·, changed phonetioally to -εύ- in

¹ Secondary formatione further discussed infru 167.

² Just like the ending -ιι in Latin, supra 125 and 161.

³ The primitive suffix may have been -dbi- ir we may judge from the
Sanskrit infinitives in uby-ai, ot. infra 296.
