logist amere monstrosity, but to the psycholcgist the sign ol'
an intellectual operation of remarkable delicacy. It is now
clear that, without the check afforded by Latin, and without Α
the historical evidence of the Erench forme, we should be
forced to admit in Erenoh the real and primitive existence of
this pseudo-euffix tier, the origin of which would escape us.
Now such a cheok and such evidence are absolutely wanting
to us in the case of the primitive Indo-European langunge3
and corruptione of thie kind, of which hundreds of examples
might be found in Erenoh derivatives,² and of which Greek
and Latin will efford us many metaneae, must necessarily have
played havoc with the Indo-European language also, from the
mere fact that this language passed through human mouths
and was thought about by human braine.8

Thus the ending -otion properly belongs only to words derived from Lntin
verbs of the first conjugation‚ like contemplation, medianum bnt the ending
atton in such words being wrongly isolated, end regarded as s fit termination
tor abstract words irrespective oi their origin, the English language has been
enriched by the acquisitiones such hybrid words aectorvotmn and fltrtotion.
The word sterculino is said to have been first used in the House oi Commone
by Mr. Dundas in 1775, and to have earned him the nickname oi “ Starvation
