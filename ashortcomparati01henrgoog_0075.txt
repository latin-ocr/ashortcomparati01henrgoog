will only be understood later on; for the present it will be suf·

finient to notice the regular alternation of ἔ and ὄ which takes

place in words ol identical formation in Greek and Latin.
A.-Simple o.- -ὄ-, the sign of nouns ol the second declension,

Gk. ἵππ-ο-ς, Lat. equ-o·s; alternation with ἔ, seen in φέρω and Α ¹

φόρος, also in δέρω (to build) and δόρ-ως (house), Lat. dom-ue,
petest-o (I weigh) and pond-c-e1(weight), sequor and roc-iu-e,

etc. ; the same alternation in φέρω and φορά, pit-adficta (to Ι

flow) and ῥοήε*ροῈ-ᾶ (stream), toy-0 and togam so also in the
derivative verbs φορέω (φέρω), σπουδάζω (σπεύδω), moneo (llatae,
to think3 cl. nae-mine, mens), noceo (*nelc-‚ herm, death, cf.
nec-c, neec), voc-o (llweq, to speak, cf. the ε of ἔποςεέέπ-ος,
word), etc.; lastly‚ in the vowel of many Greek perfecte,
0i8a=fotba (cf. the participle ferd-als), λέ-λοιπ-α (letae), πέ-
’ πονθ-α (abd-or, suffering), eto. Thislast grade of vocalism has

nothing certainly corresponding to it in Latin, owing to the ¹

many important changes which the original perfect underwent
in that language.

Greek ο remains unchanged. In Latin ὄ is liable to several
changes which are not all clearly defined.

(a) The group oo almost always became ev ; cf. ‹ae-ie and
οἰωνός, a secondary formation =*6f-r-ar6-s‚ also art-tuate, a

compound=*avi-tame (Ι augur, presumo), and οἴομαι (same J
sense)=*6F-i-o-par. We find however coi-s (sheep)=Gk. *df-ar,

Sklssllszhse initial gropp eo in close syllables always became

ce, though the archaia forms with ῦ did not entirely disappear. a
Eg. nottestane-ter, velle=*volle=*v6l·se‚ cf. vel-e, and the ,ἢ
doublets corto verte, vortere vertere, etc.; so also in diphthongs, l

eacus=oeicoe=Gh Έοῐκος (house), venam=veinom=Gh Ροῐνος;

but in open syllables voco, eolo, and even vomo, where theo ³

corresponds to a Greek ε, Gk. ε’μέωε*ῐεμέω (to vomit).

(γ) In elice (on the spot, immediately)=* n εῑόοῦ,2 the un-
accented ὄ seems to have undergone a similar treatment to ,
that of unaocented ἔ (supra 32 Α β) ; but alloquor, colloca, etc. η

¹ These two nonne originally belonged to the second declension, es is
shown by the looative dona and the aretaic ablativo ροπάῡ.
² staca is the archaia torm ol locus.
