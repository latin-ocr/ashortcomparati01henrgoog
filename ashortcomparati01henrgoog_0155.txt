junctive than to identify it with the Sanslrrit affix of the
future -cyof, the correspondence of which moreover would
involve a somewhat serioue phonetic difficulty.1

In one case, however, the formation of the future diverges
from that of the sigmatic aoriet. When the root ends in a nasal
or liquid, the aoristic -σ- ie added as usual to the simple root,
μέν-ω *ἔμεν-σα (ἔμεινα),51 κέλλω έ-κελ-σ-α. On the other hand,
the affix of the future is in thie case added to adissyllabic form,
ay. μέν-ω, fut. *μενέ-σω, whence Ion. μενέω, Att. μενῶ, audeo
also νέμω νεμέω νεμῶ, στέλλω στελέω στελῶ, φθείροι φθερέω φθερῶ,
etc. There is still adoubt as to the nature of this ι, which
seems to be inserted between the root and suffix, and which
recure in nominal formatione like νέμε-αις, γενευιήρ. The most
probable explanation ie, that it forms an integral part of the
root, one of the forms oi which would thus be dissyllabic;
and the same must be said oi the root of the verbs γαμέ-ω,
καλέ-ω, which evidently cannot be put on the same level with
the secondary form φιλέω, since their vowel remains short
in the future: φιλ-ἥσω, but *erupti-‹ro› γαμέω γαμῶ, *auli-co καλέω
καλῶ.

¹In Ionia-Attic this future ending -έω -ὣ extended outeide
its proper ephere, to the eecondary verbs in -ίζω; aq. the
futuro of κομίζω (to carry) is xopiuw=*xopid-co›‚ but also κομιέω
κομιῶ, and similarly βαδιεῖ (he will wast), ὀνειδιεῖ (he will re·
proach), Hom. κτεριῶ (ΙΙ. xviii. 334), etc.

The euffix -εω, wrongly ueed and wrongly added to the -

sigmatic sign, must also be recognised in the eo called Doric
future, aq. πρᾱξέω, which is equivalent to *πρᾶκ-σ-έσ-ω,3 and
consequently contains the affix of the future twice over. The
spelling πρᾶξίω, σπευσίω, which is aleo met with, seems to show
atendency to a semi-vocalia pronunciation of the ε;4 and, laetly,
the eontracted form ἕξῶ, attested by the manuscripts and

¹ Oi course thie explanation 'does not exclude the possibility ol the
existence in a very ancient stage ol Greek ol a future *hvayo which might
atsslength ΒανῖξοοαΙαεοαᾶ with the aoriet subjunctive λυσω.

⁸ gregim impossible, however, to overlook the great resemblance between
’πμᾱκωσδέῶνιὲ appi qphe Lat. lut. peri. ciceron *etp-scae.
