Much more difficult and uncertain then must such restorations¹
be in the languages with which we are concerned, where the

affixis reduced to its simplest 101111. We may attempt them; Ἴ

we may, 101 example, see in the final -0 01 1110 nom. sing. an old
demonstrative 100, which has given to Greek its article ὃ, we
may connect the gen. sing. δήμαο (01 1110 people)=*8op·ocyo
