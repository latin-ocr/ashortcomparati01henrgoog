3. Voconiae—The Indo-European vocative consisted of the
simple stem without the addition of any affix; moreover, it

threw back the acoent as far as possible. The latter charac-
teristic is naturally no longer apparent except in Greek; and
even there it survives only in a few casea, cp. πατήρ πάτερ. The
former characteristic, on the other hand, can still be recognised
very clearly in Greek, and it may be said that the essential
distinction between the vocative and nominative is the absence
in the vocative both of final -s and of lengthening.2 Neverthe-
less, the analogy ol the dual and plural and the neuters, in which
these two cases were alike from the beginning, has had a great
influence on the voc. sing. in two respects: on the one hand, in
certain forms, especially oxytones, it has become entirely
assimilated to the nominative; and on the other hand, even
where a separate vocative exists, its use is almost optional,
and the nominative often takes its place,3

Examples: πόλι, γλυκύ ;-Ζεῦ, ἶππεῦ, Λητοῖ;-ἅναε*ἷάνοκτ,

γύναιε*γύναικ, παῖεὴαῖδ, but generally the nominative, ἅρπαξ, ’

and even ἅναξ in ordinary speech ;-χαρίεν, μέλαν, Αἶαν, φέρον ;-
κύον, ’Ἄπολλον ;-ποἰπερ, σῶτερ, δῶτορ ;-διογενε’ς.

¹ The long vowel in ὕδωρ and πῦρ is still unexplained,

² Hence the vocative neuter is always identioal with the nominative.
