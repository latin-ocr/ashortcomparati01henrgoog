(151) I. Sufficc -yo-,-i0-‚ fem.-l·‚-ie'1.—Of all the primary
suffixes used as secondary, this group is by iar the most impor-
tant. Indead to some extent itis the key 10 the system of
secondarygnominal derivation; hence it will¹ be convenient 10
give it the first place and to consider it at some length, accord· q
ing 1ο the ending of the primary stem which is affected by it.

1. Final -e- (0), -ᾱ-.-Τ100 purast form seems tube that 10
which the vowel oi the primary suffix takes theform e, with loss
of intervocalic y: χρύσεοςε*χρῦσε-μος, aureus=⁴luuseyos
Hence in Latin the suffix -ett, which, forms a large number of
adjectivae denoting material and attributes: ros-eu-s, 11100000,
010.

In another type, peculiar 1ο Greek, the intervocalio i re·
mains: ² ὁμ-ό-ς, ὃμ-ο-ἶο-ς, tia-a δίκ-α-ιο-ς, πομπ-ή πομπ-α-ΐο-0; hence
the suffixos -aio aio-‚³ which spread in all directions, 09.
νησαῐος, παντοῖος, though there are no primary stems *νησ-ᾶ·,
, *auur-o. Often, in imitation of what takes place after a con-
sonantal stem, the suffix -e‘o- expels the final vowel of the
primary stem and is added directly to the preceding consonant,
09. Gk. cip-crde erip-circos, θάλασσ-ιι θαλάσσ-ιο-ς, and Lat.

inscriptions we donet find the double 0, eg. FVISET (i scanned 00 long) ;
but in old Latin consonante 000 001 doubled, and the pronunciation must
still have been ferisset, ior *struet would necessarily have been rhotacized.

pos-tolo, alb-ic-o, 0001110, may be passed over, as being comparativelp⁷

suffir 10 sometimes ·yo-‚ sometimes ·io-, cupra 39 influe.
