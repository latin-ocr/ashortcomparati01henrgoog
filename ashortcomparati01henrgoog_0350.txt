OONOLUSION.

(300) Here our comparative study of Greek and Latin comes
to an end. We have surveyed in all its divisions the grammar,
properly so called, of both languages, stating in each case the
correlations and divergencies. We have almost always been ’

able to account for these, by bringing them back historically ,

and logically to two principles, as simple in their character as
they are constant in their application: the agreement, based
upon phonetic lawe which are absolutely inviolable, goes back
toa common origin, the divergence arises from the particular
development of each language when left by itself, and in this
development itself the essential factor is linguistic analogy,
which is a special form oi the association of ideas. Is it
necessary at this point to warn the reader that this book cannot
be a dictionary, and that many derivative or grammatical forme
have had to be purposely excluded from an introduction which
it was important not to make unduly long or complicated?
Among these forms there are many which the student, with a
little reflection and with the help of the method into which we
have striven to initiate him, will be ableto explain by himself
without difficulty. On the other hand, there are some problema
of this kind, very few, let us hope, before which he will be
brought toa standstill; there are some of which we could not
have given him the solution, because in the present stage of
the science they are insoluble, and perhaps will always remain
so. These details are of little importance. The essential point
is that, alike in their general outlines and in their fundamental
iramework, Greek and Latin should appear to us to be really
identioal, not because of superficial and ill-observed resem-
blances, but because of characteristica which the minutest

analysis only serves to bring out in a yet stronger light, and
