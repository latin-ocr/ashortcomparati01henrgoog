yu9d=*yu9dd contracted, end the short vowel of the ek.
τρί-ο, and we can also easily see how in a combination like
τρία *crya the short ending of the first word might influcnce
the long ending of the second and shorten it. It is to be
observed that the reverse process likewise took place, at any
rate sporadically‚ if we may judge from the form τριάκοντα,
Ion. τριήκοντα, which itis generally agreed to explain through
the combination *τριᾰ κοντά (three tens).1
But this explanation will not hold good for Latin; for, sup-
posing we admit the existence in old Latinos a combination
*bend epeed, then, if *tone had become bend through the
analogy cf *opeect the final short d would have been changed
to ἔ (supra 36 A ο), an'd so the phrase would have become in
clussioal Latin *bone opert. For the a to have been kept, it
must heve been long; in other words, in the combination *bone
opesd, just as in τριάκοντα, *opeed must have become *opere
through the analogy of reone. Moreovcr we have indubitable
¹ traces of this long quantity in the imparisyllabicneuters (infra
206, rt. Later the final vowel was shortened through an un-
known cause, possibly through the analogy of the shortening of
tho same termination in the nominative singulares feminine
nouns (iufra 193).

ξ 3. Accidcntal Modifieutione.

(191) Among the modificatione, all very slight and strictly
phonetic, which certain types of this class have undergone,
may be mentioned in Greek: (1) the contracted type, πλόος
πἈοῦς, ὀστέον ὀστοῦν, χρύσεος χρυσοῦς, where however the ordinary
lawe of contraction are interfercd with by the action of
analogy 3² (2) the type with metathesis of quantity‚³ called the
Attio declension, λεώςεληός, λαγώςελαγοός, ete, namely: Sing.
