ἀπαγγέλλωσι, γράφωισι, lon-Ata φέρουσι, φέρωσι. In the non-
thematic conjugation, Dor. φᾶ-ντί, ride-vra, dido-vn, δείκνῦ-ντι,
Ion-Ait. φᾶ-σί, τιθεῖσι, διδοῦσι, δεικνῦσι.1 The lest three forms,
though correct, are not strictly Attic; the true Attio type, ¹
τιθέ-ᾶσι, dudd-dor, dccxvii-(icc (Herod. ἶστέᾰσι-τ*ἷστή-ᾶσι), is due
to the intrusion of the termination -αντι of the consonantal
verbal stems.

*ip-pti, cf. sk. ydoli, and Ion. ἔᾶσι (they are)=*io-avu‚ of “
which the regular form with reduced root would be *ἄντιε
*rr-dm. The Boeot. ἐντί, Att. etot, is merely *ἄντι influenced
by the vocalism‚ accentuation‚ and unaspirated initial vowel
of εἰμί, ἔστί,

In Latin we find tremo-pti=Dor. τρέμο-ντι (they tremble)‚ an
isolated and doubtful form, inferred from Festus to belong to
the Song of the Salii.2 'Phe secondary ending is the only one ,
historically authenticated3 it is always consonantal‚ because
it is only added to thematic forms, or forms which have been
Wrongly made thematic by analogy: sunt, ecc-nt, seru-at:
*fero-nt=Glr. (ἔ-)φερο-ν, lepor-nt, etc. The forms cla-at and
sta-nt, however, seem to contain only the simple root.⁸

(25²) The Greek and Latin systoms of inflexion in the per·
fect cannot be compared directly with one another; tho former
is to a large extent primitive, whereas tho latter has been
greatly corrupted. It will be best to consider each separately.

I. Greek.

Simulata-ist person: ·a=Slr. ·c=I.-I⁴l. lka: oid-adolio (I
know, Sk. ved-a), λέλοιπ-α, litor-a.

ret-trag ἣσ-θα (thou wast), root ἐς with temporal reduplication.

¹ The accentuation has been disturbed3 we should expect *clerica etc. But
the accentuation of διδοῦσι was probably modelled on that of the contracted
form δηλοῦσι (ci. ἐδίδους, ἐτίθει, infra 280), and similarly with the other forms.

20cme tonas, Leucetc'e. prat tet tremonti. The verse might be scanned
perhaps as a Saturnian, but tremunt would violate the metro.
