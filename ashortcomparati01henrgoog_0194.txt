6. Final liquid—Primary euffix reduced, πάσρ-ιας ρα-11·-1”ιι-1;
normal without lengthening, δατήρ, fem. δότειρα (giver)= δι’ντερ-
ya3 normal with lengthening, σαι-τηρ-ίᾶ (safety), κοιμη-τήριαν
(sleeping-room); deflected with lengthening, praetor-iac,
vic-toria, com-iterium reduced before the fem. suffix -ῑ
which is accompanied by a guttural addition still unexplained,
vic-tor, fem. vic-tr·t-c-; the termination unchanged before the
Latin suffix αῖς-1, which changes the adjective to a feminine
abstract noun, pauper pauperie-s.

7. Final -ut-.—The Latin participles have lost their feminine.
The Greek participles of all kinds form theirs very regularly in
¹·ad=·i, e.9. τιθείς = *rt-divvs, fem. saddoc: *ra-di·rr·yc,¹ φέρουσα
=*d›e'p-o-vr-ya (Sk. ὁὴάν-α-ηἰ-ῑ), λιποῦσαε*λιπ-ό·ντ-ῃα, λύσᾶσα
:ithaca-vvcc. On the contrary, it is the suffix -ia (-io·) which
is to be recognized in yepovoia=*yrp-ovr·ia (council of old men),
as well ae in Latin abstract nouus derived from the same
participles, sci-e-at-ta, coarctant-ia, and the proper noune Ooo-
atantica, Prudentius·

8. Final capturim—The suffix -ια- in Greek often had a
diminutive function, aq. ψῆφας (pebble), ψήφιαν (small pebble).
When joined to stems ending in an explosive, it produced the
forms tp-pdr-eav (little eye), ὁλκ-άδ-ιο-ιι (lit-tle ship), πα·ιδ·ιό·ν
(little child). Then these 0101110111-διο-,·ι’διο·, being regarded
as diminutive suffixos, were introduced into other formatione:
ζώ-διαν (small animal), ἀγ-ρ-ίδιον (small field), ἱ-ματ-ίδιαν (small
garment); so also in certain adjectival formatioris, {niduloru-
ίδιας (maritime), ἴδιος (camaracam-raas (1111 own). In
Latin there is no special peculiarity: audac-ia from cudda,
sust-tp-icam (top), primitive form unknown.

in Latin is added as a secondary suffix to all primary adjectives
