52. Stenas.

(220) Ι. Greek-l. Stem ὁ· τό· (demonstrative in the lan·
gnage of Homer, where the article is unknown, article and
relative pronoun in that 01 Herodotus, article only in ordinary
Greek, except in the expression ὁμέν . . . ὃ δὲ . . .). In Indo-
European, the two stems *so *to- alternated in declension; the
first characterized only the nom. sing. masc, and fem. (both
without termination, 1εο,1εᾱ); the second appeared in all other
cases. This is also what happens in Greek, especially in Dorio,
where the nom. pl. maso. and fem. is τοί ταί ; but in ordinary
Greek the analogy oss ἡ produced οἱ αἶ. The (111111τώ1111)
everywhere remained unchanged. Ἴ

By the addition to this stem 01 the particle δε, there was
formed a demonstrative of more precise meaning, ὅδε ἥδε τόδε,1
corresponding in meaning to the French “voioi ’' (here is). The
declension is the same as before; the particle is indeclinable,
but by analogy the case-endings were sometimes added to it,
loc. pl. τοῖσδεσι and τοῖσδεσσιν (Od. xxi. 93, ii. 47) in Homer, gen.
pl. τῶνδεων 111 a fragment of Alcaeus.

2. Stem οὗτο- (a demonstrative contrasted with the' former
as meaning “veile'' (there is) and with the following one as
meaning “ this '' ). Whatever opinion may be held as to the
origin 01 this pronoun, it is not difficult 10 recognise in it the
stems ‹i-, τό-, combined in different ways, whenoe arises the
exact parallel between the two declensions ὁὴτό, τόν τήν eto,
and οὗτος αὕτη τοῦτο, τοῦτον ταύτην, (tte.2 Hence the Dorio nom.
pl. maso. and fem, τοῦτοι remor, is the only regular one; the
ordinary forms οὗτοι αὗται are imitated from οὗτος αὕτη andei αἱ.
The influence of analogy did not stop there; the Panhellenio
ablativo is οὕτω, not 1τούτω; we find in inscriptions forms like
01101 and οὕτων; and lastly the stem τοῦτο· nowhere appears in
the declension of compounds like τοιοῦτος τοσοῦτος, gen. τοιούτου,
eto. Moreover, the regular nom. sing. neut. τοιοῦτο τοσοῦτο is

² Notioe however that the common gen. pl. is τούτων 101· all three gandera,
not *retroit in the iem. (of. in the adjectivae φίλων in all gandera, supra
195, 7), but in Dorio regularly ταυτᾶν.
