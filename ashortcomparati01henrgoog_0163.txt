opor-cola, parri-cirta. Greek alone possesses 00 oxytone type
with deflected root and reduplication, ἀκ·ωκ-ή,(00101), thob(
(smell), thud( (food), which seems not to have been developed
elsewhere.

(111) IV. Stems with suffice -i- (alternating with -ey- in
declension).¹-Par0xytones, very few; πάλ-00 (city, root πελ,
10 fill), *dx-rs (eye) preserved only in the nom-acc. duel ὄσσε
:way-e, ὄις (011000)ε*ὅ1-ι-ς,1101001-ος *di-rs (bird), whence
οἴομαι (Ι augur) and olo-vde, Lat. 00-1-0, Lat. pisci-s, root
unknown3 neut. Μακέων-1.

V. Stems with suffic -u· (alternating with -ew· in de·
01000100).-Το this 01000 belong the very numerous Greek
adjectives in -e, which are all oxytone, πολ-ύ-ς, βαρύ-ς, βαθ-ύ-ς,
phua-da (01γλεῦκ-ος, swsetness), stc, and all have the reduced
root, except (bd-e, 001000οε1010. They recur in Latin as
the basis of secondary stems formed by the addition of 0 new
suffix -i-, eg. pra-vde :Vlup-cm but of stems in -01- properly
sc called, Latin has very few, eg. 0000 (needle), 101010 (rights
when there is a full moon).2 The suffix remeius unchanged in
the paroxytone νέκ-υ-ς (corpse) and a few other words.

(112) VI. Stenas with suffioeee -io·, ·yo·, and -t·.-The first
two forms, which are somewhat rare 00 primary suffixes,
of course coalesoe in Latin, pen-ires, fluv-ius, ex-im-ius
(chosen, exquisite), but remain distinct in Greek, ἄγω-ς (hely,

root pap, to worship, cf. Sk. 00111010, sacrifice), ervigio-s (11010- .

ful), and 00 the other hand ἅλλοςεἪ-ῃινς, Lat. 011000.3 In
the prehistoric period the feminine form of these suffixos
seems 10 have become by contractiori -1-, 01 least if we may
judge from Sanskrit. Now, according 10 the same evidence,
in the oblique cases the -t- of the stem was resolved into ty
before terminations beginning with avowel, ep. dhe-e (thought),
000. 01111ῃο0οζ Hence we may assume 0 stem like *acb-t,
(destruction), *spele-t (appearance), 010, which, under certain
'· conditions, not yet clearly determined, became in the 000.
