two propositione ἐν and ia may be identified, if we assume that
there existed in Latin two syntectical doublets,¹ *aa and ia3
before a word beginning witha vowel *eo would not change,
*ea cyris, but it would become ia before a consonant, in domo;
then later the form ia was extended by analogy to the former
case. But we must also suppose that *eu was mostly proclitic,
and consequently unaccented.

(α) Ι.-Ε. ey=Gk. e=Lat (ei) t: I.-E. *deylc- (to show, say),
Gk. δείκ-νῦ-μι, Lat. dic-c, archaic ἀείσω Ι.-Ε. *bheydh- (to per-
suade, trust), Gk. πείθ-ω, Lat. fido. Very rarely Greek also
has t: I.-E. *dcy- (to shine), ek. mosanas, cf. Lat. dei-eos
divo-s (god, divine).

(β) Ι.-Ε. ew=Gh <v=prehistoric Latin eu3 but, as ev be·
comes ὄυ (of. A a supra), eu, which does not differ from it in
Latin in pronunciation or even in writing, becomes ou, then ot:
ek. φεύγ-ω, of. φυγ-ή, {day-om Lat. *deoc-0 (I lead), which is not
found anywhere, but evidently has the same relation to dcte-
(from dcis, dcte-ie) that peip-o has to φυγ-, historically *douc-o
(Aenovcm already cited), and finally duco.

(33) 6. I.-E. e=Gk. ⁷2=Lat e: 1.-E;*ec-eo-a (I have caten),
Gk. td-vydo, Lat. without reduplication ed-t; I.·E. *semi- (half),
Gk. ἡμι-, Lat. semi·; I.-E. nom. *mater (mother), Gk. μήτηρε
μᾱτηρ, Lat. *metten which became meter through the regular
shortening of every final syllable in r (cf. arbos and arbor);
I.-E. *dhe (to suck, suckle), Gk. θη-λή (teat), θῆλυ-ς (female),
Lat. sc-lo (to such, often wrongly written fello), se-nvinc=Gk.
*θη-μένῃ (she who suckles), cf. Umbr. sif felices: sues filies
(suching-pigs); I.-E. -ἰὲ- optative suffix, Gk. εἴηςε*ε’σ-ίη-ς, old
Latin s-ice, etc. Sometimes in Latin this c was written ei,
which is merely a graphio variation, leipibue ; but it is less
easy to explain the variant t, found in fictos (suckling).

(34) 7. I.-E. ὅπως. 5=Lat ὅ. This primitive agreement,
which has been often interfered with by the action of analogy,

¹ By syntecticcl doublet is meant the double form which the same word
may take according to the place it occupies in asyntactical group (sentencelz
thus, in French, teca and bel, the former before a consonant, the latter
v before a vowel. [So in English a before inconsonam, aar before a vovet}
