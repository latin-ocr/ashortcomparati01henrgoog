almost always in Latin iu those forms which arc certainly
thematic; for if we conjugata the regular paradigm of the
present, we obtain, cu the one hand ucho and vehrrnt=*vehont,
on the other vehis=‘cehc·e, vehi-t, vehi-tia. There remaius
only vobi-maa instead of *aamusffloa ἔχο-μες. But *veho
mae certainly became cebamus, a well authenticated archaia
form confirmed by ecimus and volumus. What was the next
stage? Did vehamur phonetically become vehimus, as optumas
became optimas or ‘mostubus maaibaatl Or was vehimus
rather developed through the influeres of echitis, ae one
is led to think on account of samua and volumus, which
apparently remained anchanged because they had not by their
side a 2nd pers. *sitia cr *solitast Whatever solution is
adopted, it will be seen that the Latin thematic flexionis
scarcely less pure than the Greek. It is only necessary to
point out the alternatione once for all.

(270) The Greek conjugation distinguishee seven tenses:
present, imperfect, future, future-perfect, aorist, perfect, aud
pluperfect. To these may be added the verba] noune contain-
ing no notiou of time. Latin has confused the acrist with the
perfect, just ae, in the moade, ithae confused the optative with
the subjunctive, and the subjunctive with the future: υῖᾱῑ and
citat are treated as the same tense, and so aleo sim and feram3
seres ie a subjunctive used ae future, and ferree a corrupted
future2 used ae subjunctive.
