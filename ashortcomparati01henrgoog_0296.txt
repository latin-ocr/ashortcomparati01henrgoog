is connected with the fact that the e of the augment, which re· .
mained anchanged before a consonant, was, ae early as the Indo

European period,¹ contracted with the initial vowel of the verb,

and so lengthened it: *e bbere-t (he was bearing), but *e age-t,

whence *opat (he was leading, Gk. ἦγε).

(233) I. Syllobic augment-l. The ordinary formis an ε’-
prefixed: ἔ-φερε, ε’-βούλε-το, ἔειπε (Hom.)=*fssfecur.

2. Very rarely ἔ· is found: the rough breathing is in this case
due to the analogy of the non-augmented form. Thus ἕρπω (to
crcep)=*ce'pro (Lat. serpe) ought regularly to become in the
imperfect *ἔ-σερπο-ν, whence *ἔερπον *elpram but instead of this
we have εἷρπον, imitated from ἕρπω, ἔρψω, etc. So also in εἵπετο
(he was following), εἱστήκει (he was standing), ἑώρων (Ι was seeing)

ἑάλων (Ι was taken), and various other casea, where the initial
rough breathing crept in from ἕπομαι, ἕστηκα (ε*σέ-στᾶ-κ-α),
dpdm, ἁλίσκομαι, ete. But we find in Homer ἆλ-το, from ἅλ-λο-μαι
:sol-to.

3. There is aleo occasionally found an augment with long ir,
whichin all probability is not primitive: ἦια (Ι went), ἥ-θελε,

ἡ-βούλετο, ἤ-μελλε (Hom. ἐβούλετο, ἔμελλε, which belong also' to
the Classical language), ἠδύνατο, Hom. ἦισκον (Ι made like, from
laaa=*lia-rao), ἠείδη (he knew), also ε’ᾶγη (it was broken)=
*ἦ-άγη from root fay, ἔώρωνε*ἠόρων, tetardi-dhar, ete. In
several of these forms the long vowel is regular: thus ῆι· is
the form with tempora] augment of the root εἰ (to go); so also
ἤθελε, ἤισκον go back to the forms with prothesis2 ἐθέλω, ἐΐσκω,
doublets of θέλω, ἴσκω. Being referred by the speakers to the
latter forme, they gave rise to the mistaken idea of the existence
of a syllabic augment with long vowel, and this kind oi augment
became still further extended in Byzantina and modern Greek.

4. 'I'he initia] nasa] or liquid of the verbal stem is sometimes
doubled after the augment in poetry, either through spontaneoue
reduplicatiomi or through imitation of the regular reduplication Ι

¹ We must therefore beware of restoring in Greek *tayoa *tehdoa * ἔορτο,
etc, tc explain ἦγον, ἦλθον, epm moreover‚ it will be seen that the two last
coph)5 ⁰an ppve become in Ion-art. ἐῖλθον and *adpro or ‘adpro
