Ι have to express my warm thanks to the author for reading
the whole of the proof- -sheets of this translation, and for much
kind assistance· , and to Professor Sayce, avho, 1n the midst of

Dr. J. A. H. Murray, and Dr. Joseph Wright for some useful
suggestions on points cf terminology3 and to my friend ΜΓ.
W. Worrall for help in passing the proof·sheets of the intro-

gent tlemen for their kind help, I must myself assume the sole
responsibility for everything connected with the English form
of this book.
