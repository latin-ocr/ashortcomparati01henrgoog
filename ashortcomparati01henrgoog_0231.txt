even in these 00000 themselves, it has taken the meaning 01 0
genitive, and everywhere aplaces the primitive genitive, 01

For (1) several verses 01 Homer where the form in ου 10 read
will not scan, and the scansion becomes correct 11 we restore
the form in 003 thus the amphimacers Ἰλίου, Αἰόλου evidently
cannot occur in 011001011010100.1 (2) The genitive ὅου 01 the
relative pronoun ὅ-ς, which is read in Homer, is evidentlya
barbarism invented 01 010101 period to restore the metre which
the reading οὗ had violated3 it is only necessary 10 substitute
1010011.3 (3) This restoration is again forced upon us almost

ἀστερόεντος (Il. vi. 108), oto, where we should read Ἰλῖο’, oripovd',
etc, with elision 01 the second 0. (4) The same restoration is
