§ l.-Oommoo Forntatiooa

(86) The whole of this system is characterined by one fun·
damental distinction. We know that avery large number of
verbal formatione, ay. in Greek the present of verbs in -ω,
¹all subjunctives, all futures, and in Latin all presente, etc,
show before the conjugation-ending a vowel o or 0, alternating
1 according 10 fixed and invariable rules.l In consequence of its
extreme frequency, the name of thematic vowel hasbeen
given specially to this vowel cle, and hence the name 01
thematic formatione 10 applied to those in which it 10
present, non-thematic to those in which it ie absent, ay. in
Greek the sigmatic aorist, the aoriste passive, the present 01
verbs in -μι, and in Latin the subjunctives, imperfecte, etc. In
spite 01 the fundamental defeat of thie terminology (for &ht-dp-
or lega-bo· is evidently a thome or stem just as much as hri-o
or 1090), we must needs adopt it; for we shall see later on,
in etudying the conjugation system, how necessary it is to die·
tinguieh everywhere the forms which contaiu the thematic elo
from those which do not contain it.

Moreover, even at thie point, the distinction is necessary.
Latin, though it kept in its conjugation 0 good many non·
thematic stems, retained scarcely any in the present; in other
words, it no longer retained any verbs in -μι. The thematic
vowel was extended in Latin by a process of analogy from
which even Greek was not entirely free, until it invaded all
