(83) Etymology is the study oi the formation of
words by means oi derivation and composition.

If we consider, in any language whatever, a group of words
expressing with different shades of meaning the same funda-
mental idea, it is almost always easy to discover and isolate
in this group a common alemant, usually monosyllabic, which
seems to contain this idea in the vaguest and most abstract
form possible. Thus, in tbe words τίθημι (to place), θέσις (plac-
ing), θήκη (box), θησαυρός (treasure), θωμός (heap), we recognise
at first sight a syllable θη (weakened θε, deflected θω),1 to
wbich we may without any improbability attribute the pross
party of representing the very general idea of “ placing, put·
ting, putting aeide, heaping up,” etc. This significant alemant
in a word is by general agreement called a root.

It cannot be too clearly realized that a root, as thus under-
stood and defined by grammarians, is a mere abstraction,
meant to facilitate the understanding of etymologica] facts,
not an historic or prehistoric reality, forming the necessary
foundation of the whole structure of language. For, just as,
in examining a groupof Freneh words like rive, ricape, rivicre,
arriver, etc, we can distinguish therein a common element riv,
with the general meaning of “ bank,'’ but, without the help of
Latin, the grammarian would be precluded from going further,
still more from asserting the actual existence in French of this
word *ηὐ, which, as a matter of fact, does not exist in it; so
also, from a comparison of the words sk. chiaddmi, Gk. σχίζω,
