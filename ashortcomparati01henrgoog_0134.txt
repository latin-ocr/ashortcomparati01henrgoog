=valent to the aeute on the antepenultimate; in other words, that
the circumflex oan never go farther book than the penultimate. ,

Consequently, to say of a grammatioal form thot it throws ¹

baok its eooent as far ae possible implios that it is (1) paroxy-
tone‚ if the word is of two syllables, forming e pyrrhie‚ iambus,
or spondee3 (2) properispomenon, if it forms a troohaio dis·
syllable ; (3) proparoxytone‚ in every polysyllable oi which the
lest syllable is short: ay. comparatives like (nom. maso.) μείζων,
(nom. neut.) μεῖζον, (gen. sing.) μείζονος, (gen. pl.) μειζόνων, eto.

All the other rules of aooentuation, including details as to
the proolitios and enolitios‚ must be sought for ina grammar
specially devoted to the Greek language. Here it is enough to
mention that the number of unaeoented words in current pro-
nunciation was muoh larger than might be supposed from the
accentuation adopted by the grammarians Thus the article,
whioh is only given as aproolitio in the nom. maso. and fem.
sing. and pl.‚ ὁ, ἡ, οἱ, οἱ, was certainly proolitie throughout the
whole of its deelension,l end all the prepositions, πρός, σύν,
νερί, κατά, were just as munh proolitios as ἐν and εἱς; the alter· '
nation between περὶ τούτουῖ and τούτου πέρι would be enough to
prove thie.

(82) Latin has altered the primitive eooentuation muoh
more than Greek3 to the law of three syllables it adds first
of all the AEolio aooentuetion, whioh throws the aooent as far ,
'back as possible; butfurthermore it entirely subordinates the
plaoe of the aoeent to the quantity of the penultimate. The
result is, that Latin nolonger has any oxytones or perispomena,
except those monosyllables whioh are neither enclitie nor pro-

alitio, adeo, mene, eel3 all other words are either paroxytone,
. tepet, tege, or perispomena‚ dnus, cowelle, or lastly proparoxy-
tone, cornelia, censae, pdtulae. ’
