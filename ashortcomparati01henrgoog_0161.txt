(107) Here aa in the verbal stems a large number of for-
mations are characterized by a vowel ose, alternating according
to regular lawa. Assuming this point to be thoroughly under-
stood, we shall henceforth represent this vowel simply by the
lettere. Moreover, as this vowel ο, with the addition in the
nominative singular of the termination -e or -au respectively,
was the usual characteristic of masculine and neuter noune,
and as on the other hand the nouus ending in ᾶ were mostly
feminine, the custom arose in prehistoric times of introducing
the same variations into the termination of >nouus in apposition
(adjectives)‚¹ in order to make them agree in gender with the
nouus they qualisy: Gk. φίλ-ο-ς, φίλ-ᾱ, φίλ-ο-ν, Lat. bon-tt-s, ⁴
boa-o, bon-uon. Hence it is sufficient to mention once for all
that every suffix given under the thematic form ο may appear
either exclusively under this form (masculine or neuter noune,
oinos, art-auen), or exclusively under the form a (feminine
noune, ποι-νή, luna), or, lastly‚ may alternate between these
forms in those noune, called adjectives, which admit ol a
change of gender.

(108) Ι. Boot-stema-This type is rather rare: Gk. ὄψ
(vetreacum, root ier (to speak)‚ cf. laos and Lat. νόσω
φλόξ (flame)=*qlldy-r, cf. φλέγω (to burn); εἶς, ἓν (one)=
*erp-aiom, cf. Lat. cem-el, etc.; Lat. υσο-εεὸψ, plusa lengthen-
ing iu the nominative which spread to the oblique casea, and
so also in ἱππῆές-3, cf. zap-era, reccdam-8, cf. repar-m also
luae=*louc-s, cf. the normal root in λευκ-ίνς (white), pau:

¹ Tha adjective ia really nothing else, and this may be seen especially in
adaptatione ol a comparatively late date, like Lat. ager aber (fertile field),
literally “a field (which is a) breast.'' Hence we should expect in the
plural cyra uberu3 but aber, naturally agreeing in number and case with the
word it qualified‚ by analogy came to agree with itin gender also, and hence
became an adjective. curt uberae. Ol. Fr. ua amuel pie [a piebald horse,
literally “a horae (with different colours like) a magpie’']‚ ling. litae

ribbona.
