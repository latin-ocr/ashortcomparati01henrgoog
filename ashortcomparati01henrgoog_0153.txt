δίζημαι (ddi-lyppia, of. (vy-rto, to seek), ln which the redu-
plication is scarcely any longer apparent, has for future
διζήσομαι; τύπτω has τύψω, but in Attio τυπτήσω; and the suffix
-veo, which, as we have seen, is lost in the aorist of κυνέω,
remains in κῑνέω (to move), fut. sci-virro, and all the other forms,
lastly, κρίνω, κλίνω, eta, have in the future κρινῶ, κλινῶ, etc, ’
just like μέν-’ω μεν-ὣ (infra 97), in which the ν belongs to the
root. In Latin, this confusion is much less common; we have,
however, already seen jtmoe-t, and party-c, which hasa regular
perfect pepigi, has also an analogical perfect panau on the
other hand, ven-io has in the infinitiva ven-Me (=*ven-te·-re l),
as if it werea secandary formation, whereas a comparison with
the Greek βαίνω shows that it contains exactly the same affix
as capio, of which the infinitiva is cape-re.

(95) XVI. Stenas with suffio ιγό· (-ἰὲ·), wealcened -Ῑιε Greek
optatives.-The gradation is very regular: δο-ίνγν dci-perr,
τι-θε-ίην rode-iper, Lab. &ie-m &id-8 s-ie·t (old subjunctive ol
sum), pl. cemus, etc, cf. sk. syrim. We see by these exemplos
that the root is weakened before this affix: the Greek optative
εἴηνε*ε’σ-ιή-ν instead of the regular *σ-ίην is explained by the
analogy of those forms of the verb in which εσ remained un·
changed, indic. *ἔσ-μί (ἔμμι εἶμί) and subj. *io-or (ἔω).

In Latin the form siem is still frequent in the comio poeta,
but in the classica] language the analogy of simus ritis
created rim sis ait, which finally prevailed. The other three
optatives kept by Latin, echion (I may eat), dui-m (I may
give) and oetion, likewise show only the weakened form of
the suffix.

(96) XVII. Stoma with saffiro -s-: in Greek the sigmatic
aorist, called first aorist, ist sing. ἔλειψα (dilect-cop), ἔδειξα,
ἔστρεψα, ἔστησα, ἕτεισα,1 from τίω, etc.; in Latin,a large num-
ber of perfecte, viat (θυείᾳ-ΜΨ of. vtvo=*veiyv-6), flecti,
scripsi, auat, fulsi, finnt, etc-Originally the root appeared

in the normal grade,3 but it was further subject to a regular ’

¹ This is the true form of the aorist often written ἔτῐσα.

l VEIXSEI is found on one oi the epitaphs ol the Scipios.

⁸ Notice the very curicus correspondence ἔτρεψα 2 ἔτραπον, thecdo : ἔλιπον,
ἔφευξα (a late iorml: ἔφυγον, etc.
