ὅ. Analogy citen introduced the temporal augment into verbs
= beginning with a consonant which was afterwards lost: thus
,οἷκέωεἺοικέω (ef. fuluo-s vicus) ought to have impl. *ἔοίκουη
instead oi which it has ᾤκουν ; so also in Hom. ἷκε-το (initial ῑ),
unless the rough hreathing isa late development, Att. ἠργάζετο
(inser.) by the side of εἰργάζετο; and the verb ἰδίω (to sweat)
:macte had already in the earliest times lost all trace of the
syllabic augment. In certain cases both augments seem to be
present: thus the regular *ἐοινοχόει (he poured wine, febor) and
’ the irregular ᾠνοχόει may have coalesced in ἐῳνοχόει, which is

found lor example in Il. iv. 3, though there ie nothing to prevent '

· · its correction tc ἐοινοχόει.

(235) We have seen that the augment does uot form an
integral part cf the verbal form. It was originally a separate
word. Now the lawe cf Indo-Europeau accentuation, re·
vealed to us by Vedio Sanslrrit, required that the verb should
be unaccented ina principal sentence, accented only in a sub-
ordinate sentence. Hence in a principal sentence the verb
was auditio, the accent resting on the augment, eg. *έ bberet;
in a subordinate sentence the augment was proclitic, the accent
resting on the verb, eg. *e liberet, and then the unaocented
augment tended to disappear, *inheret Gk. φέρε. So also, from
the remotest period, the mocds other than the indicative had
no augment, inasmuch a's they scarcely ever appeared except
in subordinate sentences.¹

According tc this, it would seem that the Greeks ought tc
have said ἔβη (he went), but λέγω ὅτι βῆ (Ι say that he went).
But,'in Greek as in Sanskrit, the augmented and unaugmented
forms were so confused as to be used one for the other; the
latter forms even in a principal sentence, in the language of
Homer and the poete, who drop the augment or not, as they
please ; and the augmented forms even in a subordinate seu-
tence, at all periods of the language.

¹ Breal however (llam. Soc. Liuy. vi. p. 333) prefers to see in the loss ol
the augment merely a phenomeuou oi syntectical phonetics.
