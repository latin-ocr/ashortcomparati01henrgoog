§ 1. indicative. '

(298) Ι. Adice—For the pluperlect there ere various modes l

of formation (Latin knows only ·one); they may 'be olassified
es foHows. ¹
1. The pluperfect is essentielly merely the augmented tense
of the perfect; hence it has the seme stem and the same
gradation.1 There ere several Homerio exemplos of this= form- ’
etion; they all correspond to the perfecte which in their
inflexion have best preserved the original vocalism: ἔοικα, ἐίκτην
(they resembled)=*(e'-)fe·fix⁶rryv3 πέποιθα, έπέπιθμεν; γέγονα,
γεγάτην (Od. x. 138); μέμονα, μέμασαν. In 'the 3rd plural, as
in almost all the augmented tenses, the terminetion -σαν -has ,
been introduced, ἐδείδισαν, ἐτέθνασαν.

2. Another pluperfeot, almost the only one used in classical ,

Greek, wes formed by the addition of the aoristic suffix -εσ-, ³

the same es in εἰδέω and εἰδείην, to the perfect stem :2 the typioel 2

form is lst sing. Hom. ᾔδεαεῦἰνέείδ-εσαῃ with long augment,i
and the inflexion, which shows no gradation, is that of the sig-

matic aorist. Soalsoe'leioioemhlehirco, etc. Hence we find in 2
Ionio the forms: lsi sing. ε’λελύκεα, 2nd έλελύκεας, 3rd έλελύκεε(ν), ,
etc, 3rd plur. ἐλελύκεσαν (for *ἐλελύκεαη through re-introduction ⁴

of the o); whence in Ati. the inflexior: lst sing. ἐλελύκη, ind
ἕλελύκης, 3rd ἐλελύκει and ἔλελύκειν, 3rd pl. ἐλελύκεσαν. To this
perhaps corresponds Latin videram, which in any ease hasbeen
corrupted by some unknown cause,4 end likewise shows no ,χ
gradation, videramus.

,3. On the 3rd sing. ἐλελύκει analcgy based in Attio a new '
mode oi inflexion‚ in occordence with the relation oi ε’τζθην ἐτίθης ’
ἐτίθη; in other words, the whole tense was conjugated on the

basis of a false siem, theleneo, namely: έλελύκειν ε’λελύκεις ;

ἐλελύκει, ἔλελύκειμεν ε’λελύκειτε ἐλελύκεισαν ( less usual then ·
ἕλελύκεσαν), ἐλαλύκειτον ἐλελυκείτην. ’
