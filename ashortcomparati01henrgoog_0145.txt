and ἔλ·ήλυθ·α, πέ-φευγ-α, iiuada, etc.; Lat. vidi, &blond-l,

rettulit, fec-l=*fe·sdc-i (cf. ἔθηκα, τέθεικα), showing the normal
grade of the root as contrasted with the reduced grade of fac-io
(supra 41, 3).

In Greek, roots ending in a non-aspirated guttural or labial
often show in the perfect the corresponding aspirato: πλέκ-ω
πέ-πλεχ-α, λέγω λε’-λεχ-α, βλάπ-τω βέ-βλαφα, τρίβ-ω &apid-c,
etc. This phenomenon is by nc means invariable: we have
just seen πέφευγα and λέλοιπα. Morcover‚ it is somewhat late;
the aspirated perfectis unknown *to Homer3 Herodotus and
Thucydides have only one instance, πέπομφας the tragedians
another, πέπροφα,· its wide extension dates from Aristophanes
and Plato. Hence it must be regarded as an analogical cor-
ruption, aided perhaps by the tendency of popular Attio to ’
aspiration3 ay. γράφω regularly had lst sing. perf. γέγραφα,
and no less regularly let pl. perf. γέγραμ-μεν,· on the other
hand, τρίβ-ω also had let pl. perf. πέπρῐμ-μεν, and the likeness
between γέγραμμεν and πέπρῐμμεν brought about the likencss
between γέγραφα and πέπρῖφα (cf. supro 62 ζ).
