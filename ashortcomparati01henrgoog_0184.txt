3. Steme ending ina nasot-From μέλ-αν· (blank), ποι-μὲν-
(ehepherd) there arose very naturally peholvo=*peh-dv-yo,
rorpaivo=*ror-pp·yo, etc.; whence the termination -αίνω, which
spread to λευκαίνω (to whiten), γλυκαίνω (to sweeten), and eerved
ae a model for the termination ·ῦνω, which was similarly formed
from ostems, θαρσύς (bold), θαρσύνω (to make bold), and then
similarly exlended, κακύνω (to injure), μεγαλύνω (to magnify). ¹

4. Steme ending ina liquid-From τέκμαρ regularly corgee
rexuclpopat=*ren-udp-yo-; bul from ε’χθ·ρό·ς, καθαρό-ς, ἅγγελως
the proper derivatives would eeem to be *ἐχθ-ρί-ω, *καθαρ-ό-ω,

*ἀγγελ-έ-ω. The Greek language neglecte to some extent the ’

vowel of the primary suffix, and, adding the secondary suffix,
directly to the consonant, derives ἐχθαίρω from *tydy-ye, καθαίρω,
ἀγγέλλω, eto. Besidee the formative suffix -αίρω thus obtained,
there arc aleo othere lese important, -είρω, -ὖρω, of similar origin„
In this class Latin has the desiderativee, par-tunic (to be in
travail), esumo=*e·d-tttr-i6 (to be hungry), eto, which have
passed into the 4th conjugation, though we do not know the
precise nature of thie element toln, to which the verbal suffix ie
added, nor whether it has any connexion with the suffix -trtro-
of future participles, in which the rt doce not seem to be original.l

5. Stems ending in a voicelcse resplende—Greek types:
φυλάσσωι-*φυλ-άκ-ῃω,αἱμάσσωε*αἶ-μάτ-ῃω,ἇι»άσσω--*Έαν·άκτ-ῃω,
ebe, then aleo φαρμάσσω (to physic) from φάρμακον, πυρέσσω (to
have sever) from πυρετός, χαλέπτω (to make angry) from χαλεπός.
It ie very likely that the neuter verbs in -ώσσω have this origin,
up. τυφλώττω (to be blind) from τυφλω·τό-ς (blinded), verbal
of the causative τυφλόω. Latin hae a class of verbe closely
resembling the latter both in meaning and formation, namely,
those in -dt-ic, caecutio (to see dimly), bauceto (to stutter),
which have passed into the 4th conjugation.

6. Steme ending in a voiced ereptumve-Greek types: ἁρπάζω
