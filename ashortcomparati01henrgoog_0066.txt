(πόλειεπόλεῖ), and must, at any rate originally, have been
prononnced ey ‚· and (2) a simple close a, produced by the oon·
traction of two ε’01φίλειι-φίλεε, imperative) or by “ compensa-

tory lengthening” (flammatae, infra 470). The first ει
however also became a vowel at an early period, and its
transliteration in Latin, which varies between c and t, AEneaa
Tiresiae, shows the undeoided character of the pronunciation
of this false diphthong.

The diphthongs with a long vowel, ᾶ1,ηι, or, underwent a
peculiar treatment. The y was probably still pronounced in
the time of Homer, and even later3 for the Greek τραγῳδός,
borrowed at an early date by the Latine, was spelt by them
tragoedus, whereas μελῳδίᾶ, borrowed later, was transcribed
melodia. However this may be, in the classical period the
semi-vowel was no longer prononnced, or scarcely so3 whence
the oustom of representing it in inscriptions only by a small
symbol written close to the long vowel (ι adscript‚ aq. Ηι).
Our typography has replaced it by the ι subscript, ᾳ, ῃ, rga
mode of writing borrowed from the Greek manuscripts oi
the Middle Ages.

anh of these gronps must be pronounced as if it consisted
oi a vowel÷w, almost like the German aa [English ow].
Their transliteration in Latin and elsewhere (ἀστόν for αὐτόν
011ἆφεόγειν101 φεύγειν in various inscriptions) puts this point
beyond doubt in the case of ov, ευ, a'nd the corresponding long
diphthongs,l probably also in the case of ωυ, which however is
very rare. ου is the only exception3 in modern Greek it is a
simple vowel tt, and it must have been already reduced to this
in antiquity.

oo, like ει, represents historically two distinct sounds: (1)
an Indo-European ow (loto=*ldw6)‚ a primitive diphthong, of
which the two elementa gradually coalesced in Greek ; and
(2)a long close ὁ, produced by the Attio contractiones two
o'a (δηλοῦμενεδηλόομεν), or by the compensatory lengthening

ηυείυ), whiob would be inconeeivable it ov had ever been reduced to ῦ and
ευ to ὃ.
