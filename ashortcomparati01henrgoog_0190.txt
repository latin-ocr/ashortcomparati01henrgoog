*leg-edam ,· for here the e is simply tha thematic vowel ot' the
verb, the same vowel which appears in lep-i-tis=*le9·e·tia=
λέγ-ε-τε. Hence it must have been lengthened through the
analogy of mone-boae, and so also in the 4th conjugation,
audi-e-ba-m. The regular contracted form audebaar=*aadi-
eda-m existe as an archaism.

III. Saffia ·bo-: futures of the letand 2nd conjugation (the
analogical futures of the 3rd aad 4th, dac-ebo, aad-the, were
created, but not retained, in the classical language).-This
formation can only be regarded as being essentially secondary.
In a combination like arefacio (to make dry), the word dre·
was originally quite distinct and is still kept so in the time
of Lucretius, who writes sol facit dre. Now, just as are thus
became joined to sacia and fle, it may have been joined also Ἴ
to the verb fac (to be), eg. *dre fao, a group in which medial
fwould have phonetically become b, are-bo (I may be dry,
shall be dry); then, through the analogy of dre're and drabe, A
monebo from mouere, amabo from amare. If we adopt this
attempt at explanation, without however concealingits defects,l ψ
it will be seen that it is equally applicable to arebam=*dre
factm, and consequently for the imperfecta.

(148) IV. defferet -ν- aad -u·of the perfect-It is by means
of one or other of these suffixos that Latin forms its secondary
perfecte. The first appears chiefly in the letand 4th conjuga-
tions, auid-ut, audo-or, whence analogy sometimes introduces
it into verbs of the 3rd, pet-t-ct from pet-o ,· the second is the
ordinary suffix of the 2nd conjugation, moa-tot, tim-ad, and
of certain derivative verbs of the 3rd, atatat=*sta-td-at(?).
The syncope of the o in audit, petttdoes not seem to be a
phonetic phenomenon, but a mere analogical corruption,2 which
however spread very widely and resulted in a still further
syncope in the tenses derived from the perfect: audit naturally
gave rise to audieram ,· imitation of audieram produced
*corderam amaram, and the corruption extended to more

- ¹ The most serious is the difference cf quantity between drdfcmo and
argblllhus uadit: auditura-statut.- statatum, with shorteniug oi the vowel
before a following vowel.
