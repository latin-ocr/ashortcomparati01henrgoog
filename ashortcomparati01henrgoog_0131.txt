accentuarmtl.

(80) By accent (accentus, προσῳδίαι) is meant the degree
of stress or of pitch which distinguishes one syllable of a word
more or less emphatically from the rest of the word. Leaving
out of sight the different kinds of partiales, which only serve
to connect together the real parts of speech, it may be laid
down as a general principle that every word contains one, and
only one, accented syllable. In words oi some length how-
ever, and especially in compounds, a secondary accent may

[English contemplation} The reverse is the case in German
accentuation, in which the principal accent always rests on
the first term of the compound, sdaoeaftasterot'sa But phono·

study oi the principal accent.

Accent is said to be one of stress (expiratory), when the
accented syllable is spelaea emphatically, thetis, pronounced
witb more energy than the others ;¹ of pitch (tonic, chromatio,
musical), when it is scay on a higher note, a third or a fifth
at most. These two clemente aro generally combined in all
languages, but in very unoqual proportions3 thus, the modern
European languages have scarcely any accent except the
expiratory (chdish however is characteriaed by very delicate
chromatio distinctions), while the langnages of the extreme
East (chinese, Annamite, Siamese) are remarkably musical.
The Indo-European accent was essentially musical ; it remained
so in Sanskrit and Greek, but in Latin from an early period it
tendcd to become a stress accent.
