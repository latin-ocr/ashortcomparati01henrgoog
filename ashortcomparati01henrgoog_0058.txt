ELEMENTS OF 'PHYSIOLOGIOAL PHONETIOS. 19

7. If the mouth, when closed at any point, is opened sud-
denly in order tolet the current of 111 escape, or if, on the
other hand, being already opened in order to pronouncs a
vowel, it then, by being closed completely at any point, sud·
denly arrests the current of air, the result is apure noise, which
forms what is called an explosive or implosive momentary
consonant.1 If this noise is not accompanied by voice in the
glottis, the consonantis called surd [or voiceless]‚ lc, t, p3
if however, while the current of air is passing through, there
is a slight contraction of the glottis, together with evibration
of the vocal chords, the consonant becomes sonorous2 [or
voicedl, y, d, b.

8. Lastly, if the mouth, instead of being completely closed
and then opened wide, is obstructed at any point, in such 1
way as to allow the expiratory current to escape only through
a narrow opening in the centro, the air passas between the
edges of this opening with a noise of friction which constitutas
a continuant, spirant, or fricative consonant. Accord-
ing as it is or is not accompanied by glottal vibration, this
consonant likewise is called voiceless, s, f ; or voiced, 2, v.

To sum up then, leaving out of consideration the simple act
of expiration (1), all the expiratory sounds may be divided into
three groups: vowels (2 and 3), consonant-vowels (4, 5,
and 6), and simple consonants (7 and 8). These must now
be examined in more detail.

1 Thus, in 1 group like appa, the two p's being pronounced, the first is
closed or implosive‚ tha second explosive. In the corresponding group abbo,
the closing and explosion ars slighter, but equally perceptible.

² The reader may prove by experiment the existence of this unconscious
vibration ot the glottis which accompanies the articulation ο1 the consonante
wrongly called “solt” First practice tho pronunciation ο1 p or b by mere
explosion, without letting any vowel follow them. This result attained, 11

intense rumbling sound. This is the vibration ο1 the vocal chorda which
penetrates into the ear through ths internal auditory meatus. Certain
ethnic groups however pronounce the voiced consonante almost without
voioe; this is the case with South German and hlsctian d and b, which to 1
French ear sound like t and p.
