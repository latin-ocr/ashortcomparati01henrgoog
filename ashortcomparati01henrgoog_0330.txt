(272) I. Adice-1. The non-thematio presents of all classeS,
εἶμι ἴμεν, τίθημι τίθεμεν, δίδωμι δίδομεν, ἴστημι (Dor. ἴστᾶμι) ἵσταμεν,
δάμνημι δάμναμεν, δείκνῦμι δείκνῦμεν, etc, in Greek, show gradation
with unusual regularity. Latin retains no trace of it: it has
, imae like ts, fertio like fers, alumne lilre stac, etc, the strong
, form having prevailed everywhere, except in damus, elatio,
where the weak form prevails.l But the inflexior of the root
*ee (to be) in each language requires special mention.

Gk: the sing. with strong form, regular; plur, lst ἐσμέν
for *σ-μέν, 2nd ε’στέ for *σή-ε’ (cf. Sk. smdS, sthd), 3rd Ion. ἔᾶσι
:sto-avve (Ati. tirri=Boe0b ἐντί )2 for *o-avrt=Sk. sdnti 3 dual
ἐσ·τόν for llo-rin The strong form of the sing. has passed into
the plural and dual. It will be observed that the forms of the
root ἐς are subject to this corruption, ag. the optative εἴηνε
1ε’σ-μην for *o-ypw (Sk. sydm, Lat. ciem). Ἴ

Lat: sing, lst oum (instead of *comi or *esrrg which would
have become lerem), very probably on the analogy of raritas ;3
2nd ὤθεε-3, 3rd cot, regular3 plur, lst sumus for ‘'s-mus,
with u on analogy of the thematio presente (volamus, *apamea
eto.); 2nd estis for *e-tis, intrusion of the strong form3 3rd
eunt for *seat=‘cr‚tt(i), through analogy of volunt, agunt. On
the other hand, the weak form of the plural, being introduced
into the singular, gave rise to the enclitio st, so common in the
comio poets and in colloquial Latin.

2. Thematic presents: λέγω, lege, supra 249, 1 A.

(273) H.Middtc.—1.Always the Weak form, τίθεμαι, δίδομαι, ,
δύναμαι, δείκνῦμαι, oto„ except in κεῖμαι, Which has the strong
form (cf. the deflected root in κοίτη, bed), through an irregu-
larity which goes back to the parent-speech, Sk. pete (he lies).*
There is no corresponding type in Latin.

2. Thematio: hipolito-lepor.

¹ This does not meon that there is a gradation in dar: datis. If due
had the strong lorm, the vocalium would probably be *dtr (el. ts'k. ἔδως and
capra 41 infim); hence we must see in it the influenoe oi the analogy of
arride.

² Supra 251, 3. , ,
⁸ Theseum: eurrrur=otm ε remur.
