B. According ἡο what we have just seen, the regular typo
ol 3rd pl. in all the other optatives would be *boi-av:
*day-git, *dibni-av, *λύοι-αν, etc. But the t became ε through
the influence of the sing. δοίην διδοίην, whence 3rd pl. δοῖεν διδοῖεν,
νοδά thesemo vocalism also passed by analogy into λύοιεν,
λύσοιεν, λύσαιεν, although there was no sing. *λυοίην

O. In the non-thematis acrists (altera vowel), the termina-
'tion being -ν(τ), we must regard as regular the Homeric forms
ἔσταν (they stood)=*c'-cr‹i-rr, ἔβαν, ἔφαν, {pto (they were, lst
sing. ἔ-φῐον), etc, and the forms found in inscriptions ἔδον (they
gave), ἕθεν (they put), δίεγνον, etc.; so also in the aor. passive,
Hom. δάμεν (they were conquered) ε*““(ἐ)·δοὶμηντ.1 Βαὴ from
avery early date the whole ending -σαν of the sigmatic aorist,
being taken ior the termination ol ἡδο 3rd plural, was Wrongly
introduced into all these tenses, and thus there arose the forms
tom-oar? ἔ-θε-σαν, ἔ-δο-σαν, edito-<raa ε’-δάμη-σαν, ε’·λύθη-σαν,
etc, the only forms recognised in classical Greek. This
analogy extended still further, since we find such forms as
ε’-λάβο-σον (they took), ἀπήλθοσαν, οὴο., in inscriptions, chiefly
Boeotian and of comparatively late date (lud century nc).

§2⁸ Primory Eadt‘ugs.

(248) As a general rule, it seems that most, if not all, of the
primary endings, were originally derived from ἡδο secondary
endings bytho addition oi ani. This purely empirical law

can be verified in Greek in ἡδο case of the lst, ind, and 3rd
sing, and 3rd pl, which are respectively -μι, δε-οι, -τι, -ντι; it
cannot be verified in Latin, because in Latin it was just these
four terminatione which generalized the secondary form.

(249) 1. Singula-1. The parent-speech had two termine-

tions for the lst sing, one for the thematic, the other for ἡδο
non-thematis tenses.

¹ supra 76, lu. cf. δάμεν (ΙΙ. xii. 14), μίγεν (Od. ix. 91) end from the
nor. in dp, ἔμιχθεν (Il. x. 180), ἐφόβηθεν (Il. v. 408), κατέκταθεν (Il. xiii. 780,
Od. iii. 108), πλῆσθεν (0(1. iv. 705), etc.

21t is possible that ἔστην end ἔστηοα once hod the seme meaning3 ii
ἔστησαν was then taken to be the 3rd plural ci ἔστη, nothing further was
needed to cause the extension of the ending -οαν,
