Thon, in the classica] period, both stems fell into partia] disuse;
as pronouns of the 3rd person the demonstrativos οὗτος, αὐτός,
eto, were used, and in the reflexive sense ἔ- barely survived
except in the combination ἑαυτόν.

The single stem of this pronoun takes the iour forms *sewe·,
1111111, *swe- and *sua The Latin deolension retains only the
last two, in which the group ew becomes s. In Greek, initia] σ
is changed to the rough breathing and medial f disappears, aq.
aco. efficti-i ; on the other hand, initial of is changed to the
rough breathing, ap. ἔπ’*σΡ-έ. Hence the doublets which
characterize the whole of this declension. Hence also, even in
Attio, tha double form ἔᾳυτόνε*σε1’ αὐτόν and udrdr=³⁸oF αὐτόν,
and so also in the 21111 person, recorda corrupted from *τεαυτόν
=*r<f' αὐτόν, and the regular oaur6r=*rf’ αὐτόν.

long vowel of Latinis confirmed by sk. md, 1υᾱ; the Greek
formatione represent, either another accusative, equally primi-

stem σφ, to which other terminatione were afterwards added? But m this
