ἀμβροσίᾰ (drink of immortality) = *d-ppo-ro-r, cf. Lat. mor-s.
When the m is initiel, it coalesces with the following labiel
end disappears: βροτός (mortal) = 11*μβροτόςε *μρστός ; end so also
before lt: filei-ore (Ι g0)=*phcioxm, ef. fut. μολ-οὓμαι and perf.
μέμβλωκαε*μέ·μλονκα. Latin also shows a labia] epenthesis
before l: err-emplum (sample), of. ern-03 and before e, sumpsi,
cf. sulm-6}

ξ 2. donante (Vowcls).

(49) All the Indo-European nesal sonante (nesal·vowels)
produce, in Latin always, and in Greek in certain positione, a
vowel (Lat. e, Gk. ἅ) followed by a nasel consonant which we
represent generally by n, ν, but which of course varies accord-
ing to the nature of the following consonant. This being
assumed, the laws regulating the changes of the nasal sonante
become extremely simple. There are three chief cases:

1. I.-E. ῄ accented (very rere)²=Lat. en=Gk. av: Gk. ἶᾱσι
:filatur (they go)=I.·E. *iygitd cf. sk. penti3 Old Lat. sieut
(let them be)=s·i-cnt=I.-E. s-iygit.

2. I.-E.p before y=Lat en=Gk. αν, efter which the group
any is treated in the usual way (supra 39 O a): ek. βαίνωε
*βάν-ῃωε*βῃ-ῃωε1ιαῖ. ecre-i63 fem. of θεράπων (servant)=
*deponet-yet, whence deprimere, and all lhe feminines in -αινα,

3. I.·E. p (rgo) generally=Lat en (ern)=Gk. α (the nasa]
sonant first developed a vowel before iteelf‚ then in Greek the
nasa] sound was merged in the vowel; so aleo in Sanskrit):
I.-E. *senc (one) reduced *erge ek. ἅ-παξεὴνῃ-παξ (once),
‹i-uldes (simple), Lat. eim-plec-c, sin-pult, eine-ul,8 sem-el3
LE. *lep-tom (hundred), ek. (braum-e, Lat. cen-trem [Eng.
hundred), I.-E. *ne (negative particle), reduced n, and before a
consonant p, ek. a· privative, ek. ἀ· privative, Lat. in- priva-
tive, of. Germ. [and Eng] un-; I.-E. *m termination of accus,

¹ scurpeus is e new formetiom the lew reguleting the character of the
nasale would require *mutue but sumptus ves formed on the model of ettmpri
:eumve

² According to whet hes been stated above (42 end 43), the nesel sonante
ought to eppeer only in unacoented syllables; but from the Indo-Europeeu
period disturbenoee of nocent took place, which shiited the eccent on to the
reduced syllable.
