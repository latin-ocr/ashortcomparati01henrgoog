The invention oi y· and v dates irem modern times. It has not

however been thought necessary to exclude these convenient .

symbols from these peges, as their absence might embarrass ,
the reader. The important point to remember is that they ι
represent respectively English ῃ in you and w in wake. '

The principle underlying this matter may be shortly stated ³

as follows: Latin kept the primitive semi-vowels pretty faith-
fully3 Greek, on the other hand, gradually eliminated them,

until noneremained except those developed subsequently in its Ι l

own domain.
The antecedent semi-vowel may be either initial or medial;
when medial, it may occur either between two vowels or

betweena consonant and vowel. It will be considered suc· ' l

cassively according es it appears in these three positione.

Gk. ἧβᾱ, in spite of the difference in the vocalism. But Indo-
European possessed also another y, confused with the former
in Sanskrit and Latin, but distinguished from it in Greek,
where it is represented initially by ζ; ep. I.·E. *yuy- (to join), ,
