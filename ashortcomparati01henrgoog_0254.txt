Latin has carried the corruption much forther3 in this
doclension the only vocative it retains is depitcr, which also
fulfils the function oi a nominative. Everywhere else it is the
nominative which fulfils the function of a vocative: coi-e,
macc-a, felioc, lapis, prudeus, homa poter, victor, cubes, etc.

4. Accusative of masculinos and lamminas-The termination
is on, which appears very plainly after a vowel ; πόλι. ν, στάσι-ν,
-1χθύ-ν, γλυκύν· Lat. puppi-m, tarum-manaa, fructum.
But in Latin a confusion took place between the ending of the
i-stems and that of the far more numerous consonantal stems,
so that avem, collem were formed like patrem31 the regular ter-
mination i·m was kept only in a few stems, and in certain words
which had become adverbs and sowere no longer thought of in
connexion with declension : parti-m (acc. of cundperti-s), '
stati-mmmm whence the not uncommon adverbial suffix
tim -sim, senaim, confestim, pedetentim, etc.

When the stem ends ina consonant, the final m naturally
becomes ιιι, and produces in Greek -a, 'in Latin -emt adira:
*τόδ-ιιι and ped-cm, ποιμένα bomin-em, φέροντ-ιι ferent-em,
πατέρ· α pat 1·- em, etta, afteraseml vowel anwed: -ἱπτι-ἢαε *iera-iffa
Λητόα (Λητώ)ε *hardy-o or *ΛητόῈ- a,² but also Dor. Λᾱτῶν, Ion.
Λητοῦ-ν.

Greek has not remained free from confusions between these
two classes oi stems. On account of the similarity of the
nominativos, the stems ἔριδ-, xime, ὅρνῐθ- and others have bor·
rowed their accusatives from πόλι· and similar stems, and henco
we find ἔριν, χάριν, ὅρνῑν ³ (also ἔριδα, dorida), etc.; on the other
hand, while the common accusative was εὐρύν, we find in the
poets the form εὐρέα corresponding to the gen. εὐρέος. The
form θυγατέροιν (on the model oi δότειραν) belongs only tc very
late Greek,
