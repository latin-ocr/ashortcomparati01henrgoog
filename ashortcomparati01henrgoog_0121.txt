of ο with a vowel offer few points of interest.

9. a—The gronp n÷t is the only one liable to contraction,
both in the Homerio period (νέκυι, dissyll, πληθυῖ (but συῒ, δρυΐ),
Panhellen. οἶός, dissyl. :maed-s (cf. Sk. att, to beget, 0011110, son),
and perf. part. fem. εἰδυῖα trisyll.), and also in Attic and the
κοινή, where however final οι remains a dissyllable, ἰχθύι. With
this exception, υ ÷ vowel is never contractcd: the nom. pl.
ἰχθύες does not 1100011011χθῦς, and the acc. pl. ἰχθῦς cannot
come from the Homerio ἰχθύας.

10. ῦ. The group t÷vowcl is rare, and is never contracted.

Most of the exceptione which seem to violate these lawa
, may be easily explained, either on phonctic grounds or by
analogy. Thus the hiatus, which exista in λεώς and seems
to exist also 111βασιλέος, 10 ducto the fact that the group εω
there replaces ηο by metathesis 01 quantity. In other cases,
as in νέοςενέῐος, hrt: Aet, κλέοςεκλεῒος, βόεςεβόἙες, datiana:
Ι*ἀκήκοὲα (cf. ἀκούω), οἶνόειςτ*Ἑοινό-Ἑεντ·ς (of. Sk. suff. -valtl·),
etc, etc, it is the comparatively late loss of af which has
brought together two vowels previously separated.1 The same
explanation holds good 01 such forms as πενταπήςεῆενπα-ὴτής,

unless the first term of the compound hasbeen simply horrowed
from 1011110 like πενπάδραχμος where there 10 110 hiatus. In

like προλέγω, which have kept the prefix, whereas in Dor.
πρῶχοντιεπροέχοντι, Att. φροῦδοςε*πρόὸδος, 'the hiatus has
succumbed to the ordinary law. Lastly, and above all, it
must never be forgotten that the written language can only
give us very imperfect information as to the contractions of
the spoken language; works were copied over and over again
