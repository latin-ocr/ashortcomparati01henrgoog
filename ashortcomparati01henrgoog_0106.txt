(61) 1. Deaspiration. In Greek, es in Sanskrit, two
consecutive syllables cannot begin with an aspirete3 hence the
first loses its aspiration: LE. *bheydb-o, Lat. sid-o, Gk.
ecte-o2÷*eetea; Lei. *thada- (to ask, know), sk. botibe-ti
(he observes), (011111111- (learned), Gk. ε’-πυθ-ό-μην (Ι asked); Gk.
ἔ-θη-ν, passive ἒωέ-θψν (Ι was placed); Gk. θρίξ (hair)= 1*θρίχ-ς,
gen. sing. rptxds=*dpu)(·de, but loc. pl. θριξί; Gk. τρέφω ((0

*θέ-θῖφ-μαη ἔχω (I hold, 11816)ξ *ἔχ-ωτ *σε’χω, of. Sk. edit-dmi,
aor. icy-or? and fut. ἔξω; in compouuds, ε’κεχειρίᾶ (truce)=
*ἐχε-χειρίᾶ; reduplication of the voiceleas aspirate by means of
the corresponding non-aspirated consonant, in the present and
perfect, κιχάνω, τέθεικα, πιφαύσκω, etc.

To this phenomenon is perhaps due the Greek ᾰ- copulative,
often used instead of d·, which is the only regular form in this
function, inasmuch as it represents the primitive group *ece-3⁴
up. d-dpdoe (crowded together, dense)=d·dpdo·s=*sey-dpdo-s,
cf. ἅπαξ, ἅπας, etc. It is even possible that the aspirato some·
times produced the same effect at a distance of two syllables:
ἅ-λοχος (wife, cf. λέχος, bed); and from these cases analogy
may have transferred the smooth breathing to cases where the
rough breathing ought to have remained, up. ‹t-«ome (wife),
audlando-e, ((0.1
’ The very rare cases in which two aspirated syllables follow
one another occur either in compounds whose formation dates
from a period later than the operation of this law, up. ὀρνῐ-
.θο-θήρᾰ-ς (bird-catcher), or in forms contaminated through a

¹ The strict character of these correspondenoes throwe suspicion 011 the
connexion of Lat. berb-a and Gk. φορβν( (fodder).

² The same rule holds good even when the second aspirata afterwards
disappeared: vteris, πίστις.

its rough breathing to the analogy oi drus, (πλόος.
