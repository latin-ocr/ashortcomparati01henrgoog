termination -bus is never added direotly to stems ending in a
consonant, but requires the insertion afa connecting-vowel -a'·

*hamenbua *ped-buo, eto, have been superseded by ped-i·bua,³
hominibus, ferentibus, patlibus, honoribus, generibus, etc..
This analogy has extended even to vooalio stems, since suibus
likewise exists, and it has changed *manubua *fedelebus to
manibus, frnalibus* leaving scarcely any forms unohanged
except portubus, iubebas, partubus, arcubus, artubus, the last
three perhaps because otherwise they would have been confused
with the dat. pl. of pars, ara and ara.

6. Looative (Greek).-The primitive termination l-oa was
superseded by -σι or -σιν;5 where the σ was intervocalio and
so was necessarily dropped, it was restored on the analogy of
those cases where, not being intervocalic, it regularly remained:
πόλε-σι, ἰχθῦ-σιν, ἡδέ-σι, ἥρω-σι, ἱππεῦ-σι, dludi, θριξί, Hom. ποσσί
-τ1ποδ-σι, with reduction ποσί, φέρουσιε*φε’ρονσι (Lesb. φέροισι)
ε*φέρονσσιεφέροντ·σι, πατράσ-ι--Ηατῖ-σι (Sk. pits-du), Hom.
τείχεσ-σι and with reduction τείχεσι. This ending -εσσι has a
very ourious history, the whole ending being taken for a ter-
mination of the loo. pl. was introduced as such into stems of
all classen, Hom. πολί-εσσι, ori-soor, ἡρώ-εσσι, add-tom, κόν-εσσι,
Μυρμιδόν-εσσι, heaven-ewa, χείρ-εσσι, subp-ewa, κερά-εσσι, etta,
etc, and at last it actually contaminated the forms which had
served as its starting-point, ey. inieaaa=*fsn-e'a-ea·ow, νεφέεσσι,

rarer, χείρ-εσι (Il. xx. 468), ἅνάκτ-εσι (Od. xv. 557). The alter· .
