§ 3. Liquid Stoma.

(211) Ι. Stoma iu -er·‚ -ter·.-In this cloes, several sterne,
especially noune of relationship‚ have kept the primitive
gradation with more or less fidelity: nom. sing. πατήρ, 666.
πατέρα, 100. πατρ-ί, gen. πατρ·ός; nom. pl. πατέρες, acc. πατέρας,
100. πατράσιε*πατρ-σι (cf. 8111112110), gen. πατέρων. Such is
the classical paradigm3 but, although the declension of πατήρ
16 the best preserved of all in this class, it contains at least
one form that hasbeen corrupted; the acc. pl. ought perhaps
to be reduced, *τοτρος; the gen. pl. certainly ought to be, just
as much aethe gen. sing.‚ and moreover πατρῶν 16 found in
Homer (Od. iv. 687, viii. 245); hence πατέρων must be due to
the analogy of πατέρες.

This analogy spread over a wide area in course of time ; in
the Homeric age it created πατέρος, μητέρος by the side of πατρός,
μητρός; μητέρι, 1111611166 Homeric, 16 probably the primitive
form, cf. sk. 66016111. So aleo θυγατέρος was formed on the
modulos θυγατέρα, and on the other hand θύγατρα (Il. i. 13),
1 θύγατρες, θύγατρας (Il. 11111162) on that of θύγατρος. The word
that has received the worst treatment in classioal Greek 16
