Attio; but *κεφολᾶνς in its turn must he a shortened form oi

*κεφολᾰνς since the nom. sing. is κεφαλᾶ-οι result of the above·
mentioned law. So also we have dat. pl. ἵπποιςε*ῑππωις, of.
dat. sing. ἵππῳ and Sk. instr. pl. dpcdi83 ssois=*l3aie, ci. Lat.
bos and Sk. ydu83 ypoderie=*ypudnds, cf. gen. γραφῆ(Έ)-ος, and
the dialectica] doublet γραφής; aor. pass ἐ-δάμ-ογν (Ι was oon-
quered), Hom. 3rd pl. ddpev=*ddpevr=*ddp-p·vs.

B.·-The shortening oi a vowel before avowel takes place
sporadically in all Greek dialeots, but especially in Ionio-Attio,
in the case of η and o: Hom. gen. ἤροοςεῆρωος, ΠηλέοςΞ
Πηλῆος; Ion. gen. βασιλέος, Dor. βασιλέοςεῖιθεὶ). βασίληος from
*Basiliden Ion. νέες (εὶοὶρο)ενῆεςε*νᾶϊες; Att. gen. pl. χορῶν
:lom χωρέωνε*χωρήωνείΕοῙ. χωρᾶων, etc.

e-In Ionio, but more especially in Attio, the groups ηο,
ηε, ηο become respectively εᾱ, εη (contracted to η), aa (often
monosyllabis in the termination of the genitive). This is the
phenomenon called metathesis of quantity: acc. sing. βασιλέᾶ,
aco. pl. βασιλέᾰς (Att.)= βασιλῆα, βασιλῆας; Ait. (Aristoph.)
ἱππῆς (knights)=*ivm'pe=imiyec, but simple shortening in the
doublet ivreir=10m ἶππέες; Dor. λᾶός (people), Old Ion. ληό
(Hipponax), New Ion. λεώς, Att. λεώς, and so also Att. βασιλέως
εβοοιλῆος.1 We see that tho point of divergence between
simplo shortening and metathesis of quantity is not clearly
marked. ’

2. In Greek, the lengthening ol a short vowel is always
either compensatory, of which we have seen many instances, or
purely prosodia, when it depende on the rules of prosody.

ξ 2. Latin..

(77) 1. k-rha dat. pl. equis shows that in *caudis the
same shortening took place as in ἵπποις, for an original form
*equote would have given *equos cf. dat. sing. eqco=*eqoot.

B.—In the classical period, every long vowel before a vowel
became short3 the few quantities like diei (ci. fidtt=fidci,2

¹ ἕως (until) is treated us a trochee in Homer (Il. xv. 539, Od. iv. 90,
vii. 280, etc.); hence we must read *aior=*vi-for=flk. poi-vot (same sense),
which was afterwards by metathesis changed to ἕως.

² The a is still long in Plautus3 ap. in the bacchias versemini fidei
tristique* rei (Artlul. 121).
