cousoururs. 77

Owing to different causes the groups σμ, σν were subsequently
ψ restored in Attio: the former remained unchanged, the letter
was assimilated to νν, as may be seen from the juxtaposition
ΠελοπόννησοςτΠέλαπος νῆσος. Thus a verb* ἔσνῦμι, formed on
the analogy of ἔσθης, etc, became in Attie ἔννῦμι; but κόσμος, ·
ε’σμέν based on ἐστέ, ἠμφίεσμαι based on ἠμφίεσται, and even ,
πέπυσμαι and ἦκουσμαι, where the σ has not even this justifica·
tion (supra 64 A), underwent no change.

4. Before α liquid. In Greek σ is assimilated: ἔρρεε (it
flowed) :fferpef-e, sk. derce-ot, from ῥέω; but sometimes, under
somewhat obscure conditions, it is lost with compensatory
lengthening, ep. *χέσ-λιοι (thousand), of. sk. (sa-)bets-ro-, Lesb.
χέλλιοι, Dor. χήλιοι, Ion-Aet. χείλιοι χῖλιοι. In Latin compen·
satory lengthening is the rule before l, dilu63 but the mediol
group er becomes br :1 fenebrfe=tfenes-rf-s, cf. fertus fener-ie
funes-tecm om-sobwuos (cousin)=*eoo-svesr-ioo-s (relation on
sister's side), from *rcesor=soror,2 etc.

5. Before αιι ereplosive. Before α voieeless explosive e is
kept in Greek and Latin. Beforea voioed explosive, it is kept
in Greek, but pronounced asz (the group σδ is written ζ); in
Latin it is lost with compensatory lengthening: nidus (nest)
=*nt2dos, ef. Germ. [and Bng] nest, end the juxtapositions
clepere, diduco, etc.

6. Before α spirant. The groups sy and ew have already
been discussed. The group es, when primitive, was reduced in
Greek at a very early dete to e single o: the Homeris doublets
ποσσί and ποσί, ἔπεσσι and ἔπεσιν ere well known3 so too the
Homerie ε’·τέλεσ-σα (Ι accomplished), the only regular form, cf.

τέλος (end), became ἐτέλεσα, and πέπυσσαι (Ηοηι.)ε*πέ-πυθ-σαι
was reduced to πέπυσαι.3 In α few cases this change affected
the group σσ, even when it was not original, but the result of
phonetio assimilation, ey. when erising from dlry in Att. μέσος4
εμέσσοςτ*με’θ-ῃα-ς, or from δια in Att. teos=looos=ftofo=o In

¹ The intermediete stage is of course thr, supra 66 end 68, 3.

² Svesr is the reduced form: sk. nom. ινάιᾱ, det. sodor-e.

¹01. supra 63 β. The enelogy ol the doublets whieh sometimes oon-
tnined σ, sometimes ro, introduced the double σ into forms where it had no
etymologicel justificetiom ep. Hom. τανύσσαι, ἐγέλασσε, etc.

⁴ We should heve expected *μέτται es rptrro=rprlrcm
