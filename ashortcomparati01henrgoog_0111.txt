The numerous cases in which this finali seems to be repre-
sented hy r-e.y. the doublet οὕτως and all the adverbs in -ar

¹ derived from adjectivae, retardarat, cf. Lat. certo-must be

due to the existence of syntectical doublets.¹
Latin only drops the last explosive in a final group, ay.

found in all old inscriptions, and the metre often requires its
restoration in Plautus.

(66) 5. The Aspirates in Latin. The fate of the
aspiratos in Latin is remarkable. It ie not nnnatural that yh,
should be changed -hy deaepiration to y, or that, on the other
hand, the aspiration should prevail, thus changing it to h.
The transition from initial dh and bh to swas affected through
the intermediate stages of th and plu for ph easily becomes f,
as is shown by Greek φ, and th pronounced as a spirant
(Elng. th) is equally near to fd But it is less easy to under-
stand why Latin medial f should go back again, sometimes to
d, sometimes to b. It ie probable that this took place ata
time when the medial sound had not yet become f, but had
reached, say, the stage of th or some other sound closely akin to
it; at thie point the further development ci the sound in Oscan
and Umbrian took the direction off, whereas in Latin it took a
different direction.
