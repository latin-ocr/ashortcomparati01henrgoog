ἓ 1. Vowele.

(20) 1. Oral Vowels The two opposite poles of vocalism
ere i [Eng. ee in seetJ, which is essentially the high-toned ¹
vowel, and u [Eng. oo], which is essentially the low-toned
vowel. In pronouncing i, the larynx rises and the cornere os
the mouth are widened in such away as to give te the sonorous
tube the least length possible ; whereas, in pronouncing u, the
larynx is lowered,1 and the lips are thrust forwerd, so that the
length becomes as great as possible. Between these two lies
the vowel of equilibrium, a [Eng. α in sathael, the sound which
is produced when, the organs being in a position of rest,l the
soft palate is raised and the glottis begins to vibrate.

Between these three chief notes of the vocalic scale there is
naturally roem for a large number of intermediate sounds; thus
we ascend from a to i through open e (French t [approximately
English ai in air]) and close eOErench a), and again we descend
from a to u through open oOEr. homme [approximately Eng.
ο in hell) and close ο (Fr. eeu). The o sounds end thee
sounds in their turn have, es intermediate sounds, respectively
the German ὸ· (Fr. eu) and the French c mute. Lastly, if the
larynx takes the position required for i, while the lips are
placed in the position required for u, we shall hear the mixed ,
sound represented by German a or Trench u.

2. Nasalized Vowels. To each orel vowel there neces-
sarily corresponds a naselized vowel. Thus, if we pronounce a
without raising the soft palate, the result is the two nasale
’ in the French word ecferat. The most common instances
besides this are ee (of patera, often written in in French), ort, .
· and ua (Trench), corresponding respectively to a, ό, end ὅ. But
languages rich in nasals, Portuguese for example, possess many
others. '

tuber-anca ol the larynx vhilat ulter-ing these tvo sounds alternately with
some energy. · ² saprum, 1.
