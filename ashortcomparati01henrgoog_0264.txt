n ination, is shown most clearly by Sanskrit. But Greek still
χῖ ows it by the striking contrast in accentuation between
π τήρ πατέρα and πατρός πατρί. Further, the accentuation‚
hich was the primary cause of the gradation, has remained
nchanged in many stems from which the gradation has dis-
appeared, namely in all monosyllables, εἷς ἕνα ἑνός ἔνι’, πός πόδο
ποδός ποδί,1 and so also in the plural, πόδες πόδας ποδῶν ποσί, and
in the duel, πόδε ποδοῖν, but here probably through the analogy

n of the singular, for the law of gradation in the plural seems ‘to .
have been different.

(208) Gradation is so general and so constant a factor in
the whole system cf inflexion that we are enabled to assert
with almost absolute certainty that it dominated even those
stems in which it is least apparent. Where it has been lost in
declension, it often reappears in derivation, which is subject to
the same laws. Thus, in spite of tempus temporie, the regular
declension tempus *temperis (cf. pertua poneris) is revealed to
us by the derivativas temper-ore, temper-tos (cf. gener-ore),
and we sce at the same time that the o of *tempta *corpor
’ hasbeen wrongly extended to the oblique cases. So also the
primitive declension bonos *boacas is shown by the derivatives
hones-tua, boues-tos, by the genitive ouer-ia, which belongs to
an identical stem,2 and, as the formation of bonos is undoubt-
edly identical with that of the Greek οἰδός,3 we shall hence
infer the existence of a declension αἰδώς *atticen more ancient
than the declension αἰδώς *αἰδόσος So, lastly, the reduced
form -o‘s- cf the comparative suffix ·ios·, though no longer found
in the declension of the comparative, appears before the
secondary superlative suffix, μέγ-ωπος, Ραπ-ῑς-οόοηοι-ο.4

This is not all. The declension of such stems, when viewed
in each language separately, seems uniformity itself. But itis
only necessary tc pass from one language to the other to per-
ceivc the primitive variety, which hasbeen changed to uni·

of πᾶς in the plural only, παντός παντί πάντων πᾶσι.

declension and introduced the o in derivation, onus-tua.
