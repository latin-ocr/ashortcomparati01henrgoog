think 11 the ease with which a child learns its own language,
of the prodigious affort of memory implied in the storing of the
hundred thousand words 11 1 language in an ordinary brain,
11 amillion of words or more in that of a polyglot, we shall <
be convinced that this is only possible because the words so
learned arrange themselves in our mind in familias and groups,
by a continual and almost unconscious process of classification,
1 process not etymological of course, bnt purely empirical and
based on merely external features 11 resemblance. Without
this phencmenon, the understanding 11 1 language would bc in-
conceivable. Pronounce 111 the first time the word raptast
before a child who has not heard the word before3 he will
understand, provided that he knows the positive swift. Why?
Because the connexion 11 quiclc quickest, kind kindest, bip
bippest, etc, immediately 'spoke to his mind far more elo· ,
quently than the best 11 dictionaries. But do not be surprised,
after that, if he should happen to say 1111 *11111111 11 *bad-
dest. Suppose Demosthenes was the first 11 111 the verb

11 was none the less understood, even on its first utterance,
by the most illiterate 11 his contemporaries just 11 in our own
day the unknown French journalist was understood who first
created the word “ Opportunist.’' Owing tc this power 11
analcgy, it is no exaggeration to say that each individual de-
rives his language from himself, at least as much as he learns
1t from others3 hence it is not surprising, 11 language, thus
created anew by every thinking being, necessarily undergoes
from generation to generation many accretions which, while
enriching it, are incessantly changing its form.
