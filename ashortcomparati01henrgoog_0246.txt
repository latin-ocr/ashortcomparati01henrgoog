Greek ὅσσᾶν, 11 Latin 10001ἒ111,11011 which forms each language
derived a different system of inflexion. The process in Greek
isos the simplest character3 01 dcciv was based a'nominative
ὄσσᾶ, 01.χώρᾰ χώρᾶν, and 00 also in the case of all nouns in ἃ
ol the lst deciension, μοῦσα (Lesb. μὸῖσα, Lacon. pdd)=*povrya,
δόξα = *domyd plZa=*fpidyd‚ ἅμιλλα = *dpthyd‚ γλῶσσα = *yhdyyd
σφαῖραε1οφάρῃᾶ, 010. If γλῶσσᾶ had then been declined
strictly on the analogy oi χώρᾰ, thegen. sing. ought 10 have
been *γλῶσσᾶς, and so on with the other cases; but it is easily
conceivable that the long vowel of *χώρᾶς would lead 101

similar lengthening in γλώσσᾰς,1 Ιο1.-Α11. γλώσσης, 00 that the ᾗ

two declensions no longer differ except in the nom. and acc.
sing, which show the original short vowel.

In Latin we have similarly :—Sing. acc. speciem abl. specle:
speciem=terrdz terrum gen-dat. speciei, like 1011111 3 Plur.
nom. specics, which perhaps recalls the lost nom. pl. *ter·r·cts‘²;
acc. species, cf. terram abl-dat. speciebus, cf. deubas; gen.
specierum, cf. 1011111101. There remains only the nomsing.
species, which cannot be compared either with terrui or *terra
and requires adifferent explanation.

The fact is that the Latin 5th declension is far from being
uniform and primitive. Various types of very dissimilar origin
have found their way into it under 1110 influence of analogy
although its main basis consists of femininos like speclea,
parmarias, avarities, etc. Thus dies=tutuwa is equivalent
10 Znio=³lzrpic² and properly belongs 101110 3rd (1001011101;3
but, its acc. diem=²tuiem=zev being like that of speciem, etc,
it follows their mode of inflexione Res was also of the 3rd
declension‚ but its acc. rem=²lrem has made it follow in the
same direction. Lastly, spes was a stem in -es-, as is abundantly
proved bytho verb sperdre and 1110 adverb prospere=²lprc
spere (according 10 one’s hope), whence was afterwards derived

’ ¹ Thus yhaiuudr (dal. singu: γλώσσᾶις (dat. pl.)=xdpdr: χώρῖιις.

that in actual usage it belongs 1ο both gandera.
