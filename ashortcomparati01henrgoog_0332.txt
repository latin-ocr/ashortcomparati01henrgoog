the lst sing, which was taken from another tense.¹ From the
point of view of meaning the Latin correlative is lepom lepos.
(275) ΙΙ. Minicia—The type with ashort vowel is entirely

superseded by the type with a long vowel, δεικνύωμαι like
λέγομαι. Dialectically Greek has also another type, either
primitive, or more probably analogical, formed by lengthening
the predesinential vowel of the indicative: ζώννῦνται (Od. xxiv.
89), ῥήγνῦνται, fiviyvu'nvu,8 Dor. δύνᾱμαι.

Long vowel: Gk. λέγομαι, λε’γη, λεγώμεθα, λε’γησθε, Lat.
(lepor), leporio, ἱεμένοιο, the corresponding forms in regard to
iunction being lepor, leporis, legemur, etc.

ᾗ 3. optative.

(276) Ι. Action-l. The optative of the non-thematic
present has the sign -ιη- in the strong forins, -ῑ- in the weak
forms,³ and this alternation is generally very strictly observed,

, τιθείην τιθεῖμεν, διδοίην διδοῖμεν, εἵην εἶμεν, etc. But in Now
Ionic and late Attio the strong form passed into the plural,
thus producing forms like διδοίημεν, εἴημεν, with the hysterogene
ending -oov in the 3rd pl, διδοίησαν, εἴησαν.4Ε

In Latin, on the contrary, it is the plural which has imposed
its stem on the singular3 there is no traco of gradation except
in siem (sice siet arch.) simos, everywhere else we find the
weak form, sim, velim, duim ⁵ (called subjunctives).

In the verb εἶμι and all the verbs in νῖνμι there appears,
based on the model of ἴωμεν, δεικνύωμεν, an optative ἴοιμι ⁶ (also
ἰοίην infra), δεικνύοιμι, corresponding to a thematic indicative
illo, δεικνύω, the regular forms *ῖίην *δεικνυίην having disap
peared without leaving the slightest traco of their existence.

2. In the thematic present, the sign is -ι- with no gradation,
λέγοιμι λέγοιμεν, τῖμάοιμι τῐμάοιμεν (Attio ripqivyv=vipnoipv on the
analogy of διδοίην).7 Latin correlative, very doubtful, arcena: Δ
*cannot-m (l) or 'amet-peno (l), supro 144.

¹ Supra 104, 143 and 141.

² Thus ῥήγνῦται : ῥήγνῦταιυφέρητοιι φέρεται.

³ Sapra 95. ⁴ Sapra 247, 3 0. ⁶ Supra 95.

θ Hom. τοι, and oven ἔοι (may he he) ι’*ἔσοι

⁷ Later, in vulgar Greek, φιλῴην on the model oi τῖμῴην, and even δῴην,

δῴημεν.
