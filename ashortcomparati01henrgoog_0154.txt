analogy introduced uniformity into this mode 01 conjugation,
and, under the influence of different circumstances, sometimes
tho normal form (ἔλειψα ε’λείψαμεν), sometimes the weakened
form (ἕσχισα ε’σχίσαμεν), prevailed in 011 persons and all
moods. In certain cases, we do not even find either of these
forms, but a form with a long vowel, ἔλῦσα, which seems to
be a compromiso between the two regular forms *11εο0- 001
*ξ’-110. The flexion is even more uniform in Latin, in which
it hasbeen corrupted much more than in Greek, since it is not
distinguished from the flexion 01 the perfect in regard to the
person-endings.1 With these reservatione, it may be said that
the forms of the sigmatic eorist in the two languages show
a decided agreement.
