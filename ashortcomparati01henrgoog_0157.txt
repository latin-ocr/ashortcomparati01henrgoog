Π. Steme with suffice ·κ- preceded by reduplicatica with tlte
ceroci e : Greek perfecte, called first pertentati-toxa, debora,
βέ-βη-κ·α, rimare-u, ἔστηκαε*σε’·στᾶ·κ·α, etc-It would hardly
have been necessary to mention the preceding class, but for
the fact thet it must be closely connected with the Greek per-
fects in -κ-, which are much commoner than the radicalperfects. ¹
On the hypothesis above mentioned, we see 1111111έ-θεικ-ιι1 (cf.
Lat. fec-t) and δέ·δωκ-α would be regular perfects like lit-llorere,
and that from them the r, being regarded as an affix, would
spread to other verbs also.2 But the remarkable extension of
this addition x, as contrasted with the slenderness of its origi-
nal basis, has given risa to legitimate doubts as to this view3
hence other explanatione have been thought of, and in parti·
cular a particle κα κεν κε, identical with the enclitic κε which
gives the verb a conditional meaning in the Homeric language,
and it has been supposed that this enclitic, being frequently
used after the regular perfect (iird sing. *δέδω κε) ended by

coalescing with it. This conjecture also is open to very serious ’

objections. The question cannot yet be regarded as settled.3

Furthermore, it will be noticed that the guttural never
appears except in the active; the perfect middle is always,
according to the usual terminology,a second perfect, that is,
in it the verba] terminations are added directly to the root,
ey. λε’·λυ-μαι and τέ-θη-μαι formed like λε’·λειμ-μαι, in spite of the
difference of formation in lli-lorea and λέ-λοιτ-α.

(100) III. Stenae with suffice -σο· preceded by reduplication
reith vowel e: future perfect--The typical form leid-<ropac is
evidently modelled on it-lopar and the relation of λύομαι to
λύσομαι. We know that it scarcely appears except in the
passive voice. Attio however has some future perfects active,
in which even the hysterogene guttural of the perfect active is
present, ey. τεθνήξει, ἑστήξω, modelled on *sidrac-a, ἕστηκα.

¹The vocalism of the root here is somewhat puzaling. Moreorer, ’

damasec-t is likewise found in Attio inscriptions.
,5² Thus ἕστηκα : ἵστημι-τδέδωκα : diderat

³[ The history of the Greek perfect in -ra has been well given by Curtius
in his Greek Vere, pp. 408 ff. (Murray, 1880), though his explanation of its
origin is now generally regarded as insufficient. The origin of this perfect
has been briefly discussed by the translator in the Trurnactionr os tte
Oesord Plriloloyiecl society sor leet-e, p. 23 (clarendon Press, 1888, 11.).]
