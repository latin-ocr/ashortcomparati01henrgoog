vpry natural process of analogy, aq. ἐχύθη (it was poured),
c . ἔχυτο, etc. .

It is hard to explain the deaspiration of the second aspirato
instead of the first in the type λύθητι (be loosed)=*hv'd⁷†dr.

The most probable explanationis that λύθητι for *iturae is ’ 1

due to the analogy of the third person λυθήτω.

. (62) 2. Assimilation. We may distinguish two chief
cases of assimilation: A.—the explosive does not change its
nature, but a voioeless consonant is replaced by the corre-
sponding voiced consonant, or vice versd; B.—the explosive ie
changed 1ο 0 nasal or spirant.

Α.-(α) As a general rule, in Greek and Latin, a voiced ,

followed by a voiceless consonant becomes voiceless, and a

voioeless followed by a voiced consonant becomes voiced, and '

the evidence of the grammarians justifies us in asserting that

this change regularly took place in pronunciation‚ even when λ’

not denoted in writing: Gk& ἐγβιβάζων (iason), usual spelling
ἕκβιβάζων, κάππεσε (he fell) = *κάτ πεσε, with assimilation of 1116
dental to the labial‚ but κάββαλε (he threw down), etc.; Latin

prefixes ap· and op· in aperio and operte, but abditae, cb· ,v
ditch, sub-dccc, etc, and the wrong spelling obtineo did not 'g

prevent the pronunciation optineal Hence these prepositions

as used separately (cf. Gk. ἀπό, ὑπό), must be regarded as syn· 1

tactioal doublets; the Latins vfirst said regularly ab domo,

sub 9000016, then through analogy ab urbe, rub iove3 but in ,
spite of the spelling, they never ceased to pronounce sup caelo, 1

sup aaran

(β) In accordance with the same law, the groups, Gk. γσ, ,

Lat. pa, become κσ, Ire, written ξ and oe3 Glr. ssu‚Lat. bs, become

s πσ (written ψ) and ps: Gk. φλόξ (flam), cf· gen. ‹thoy-dr, Lal- ³,

rear, cf. gen. req-im Gk. φλέψ (vein), cf. gen. φλεβ-ός; Lat.

Α ple‘pa (written plebs), cf. gen. plebis 3 scrib-c, but scrip-at, ,

scrip-tata, etc.

(y) So also the Greek groups φσ and χσ are written ψ and ξ, l

¹ In French 001οο01000 is pronouneed npetu 0110010, optenta, etc.

² Ol. also the Homerio forms κὰκ κεφαλήν, κὰγ γόνυ, ὑββάλλειν (Il. xix. 80),
and many others. In Latin inscriptions the spellings set. aput, etc„ are
often round. not only before a voiceleas consonant, but in other cases als0;
tha Latine said aput tc, 001 contra, and hence aput 000, ret milri, etc.
