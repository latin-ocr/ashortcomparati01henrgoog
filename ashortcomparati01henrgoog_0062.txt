under the less precise appelletion of¹ gutturals: the velar
gutturals, q, p, are those heard in the English words cccl,
qood, and especially in the German laub (cow); the palatels‚
lc, 9, are those heard in the English bey, gift. Ehe dentale,
t, d, and the labiale, p, b, require no explanation.

2. Spirants.¹ The following are the most common spirante
(taking them in order according to the position of the half·
opened aperture through which the air passesl: (a) the
voiceless velar‚ German cb in dach, aocb; (b) the voiceless .
palatal, German ch in ich, blecb3 (c) the voiceless and voiced
cacuminale (Erench ch and j [approximately English eh and e
in pleaeureD, denoted respectively by t and ἐς (d) the voice·
lees and voiced dentale, or rather alveolars, a and 23 (e) the
voiceless and voiced interdentale, English ta hard and eost,
(s) the two labiale, f and v.

3. Modifications of the Consonante. 'Phe two chief
possible modificatione of the consonante are aspiration and
mouillement [or palatalization.]

A.-Aepiration affecte scarcely any bnt the momentary
consonante. It consiste in the explosion being more energetic,

, and accompanied by the forcible expiration2 which we have
designated by 113 hence the consonante of this class are
denoted by qh, lcb, ta, pb (voiceless), gb, ph, dh, bh (voiced).

German initia] lc ie the beet example that can be given of an
aspirated explosive; a qb is heard in kalt, a kb in atad (child).
When the exploeion of the exploeive melts gradually into
the enpiratory breath which follows it, the two eounds end by
coalescing into one, that ie to say, into the corresponding con-
tinuant or spirant. Thus the transition ie easy from pb to f,
from ta to the alveolar or interdental sibilant3 and the German
phin karb hae become evelar spirant in the Swiee dialects.
B.-Mouillement, a phenomenon eaeier to reproducc than to
define, may modify not only all the momentary and continuant
