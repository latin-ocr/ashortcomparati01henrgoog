decl. masc. πολίπᾱο is undoubtedly bdrrowed irem the 2nd3 but,

if it had been imitated from ἵπποιο, its form would be *πολίταιο;
hence it must have been formed in a dialect in which the pro-
nunciation at the time was¹ *ἵπποο (7) There is nothing incon-
oeivable in the loss¹ of the form *ἵπποο if the Homeric poems
have been translated into a language which no longer possessed
this genitive (the language of the Ionian rhapsodists); it is
rather the preservation of the type in οιο which might surprise
us, did not the metre absolutely require it, together with many
other archaisms.

. The forms θεοῖο, ἵπποιο, survived, through imitation of Homer,
in the language of poets cf all periods. Prose retained only the
contracted forms of *deo'a *ἴπποο, namely‚ Lesb. Bceot. Dor. θεῶ,
ἵππω, Ion-Ati. θεοῦ, ἵππου.

By a process the reverse oi that in Latin, which has super-
seded this genitive by the locutive, Greek employs the genitive
of certain pronouns in a locative sense: ποῦ (where Ρ), οὗ
(where), αὐτοῦ (here), etcl

(188) H. Dect—l. Dircct Gasc (nom.·voc.-aoc.): the final
vowel (probably -e, if we may judge from adhe, etc, of the 3rd
declension) having been contracted, in the Indo-European
period, with the thematic vowel o-, the result was an o, which
forms the Greek termination, tmo=rotwc=wcwcc Latin
has lost this form, except in the two. words doc2 and ambo ,· and
even here it only serves for the nominative masculine and neuter
and the accusative neuter; the accusative masculine has the
plural form, duos, ambos. Besides δύο Greek also has δύο, a
much commoner form, the shortening of which is still unex-
lained.

p 2. Obliquc Gase (1) (exclusively Greek).—Neither Latin nor
any other indo-European language shows anything analogous

¹ For the sake of completcness may be mentioned also: (1) the locutive
in -θι (πόθι, Ἰλίοθι), produced by the combination ot the ι of the locative with
tbe ablativo termination -θεν; (2) the illative οῖκόνδε, obtained by the addi-
tion to the ordinary accusative ol a demonstrative and enclitic particle
which intensifies its meaning; (3) the more obscure illative draca (imitation
of tuate? cl. aleo φύγοιδε); (4) the rare illative in -σε, which isquite ob·
scure, πόσε, ἄλλοσε.

² But commonly duo, supra 77.
