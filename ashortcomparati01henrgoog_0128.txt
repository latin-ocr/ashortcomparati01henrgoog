*nc-hemo. At the beginning of a word we know that it does
not even prevent elision, and that in some of the Romanos
languages it is not pronounced, while in others it is not even
written. Hence numerous doublets like holus (vegetable,
Gk, χλόη, grass) and olus, herus (master) and erus, toreama
honourable burden) and onus, etc, and the usual suppression of
theb in aaser=honser (gome, cf. Gk. χήν, Germ. qaas [Eng.
peccel), and crena (sand)=harcaa=*hases-aa, Sabine fascea,
Gk. χάοςε*χάσος (inert and incoherent matter). On the other
hand, the b, being no longer pronounced‚ was wrongly added
to words like homerus (shoulder):umerus=*omesos‚ cf. Gk.

the other hand, is the loss of a vowel or syllable in rapid
pronunciation.

and β in the groups νρ and μρ, and the prothesis of a vowel, which
is almost always found before p, and is pretty common before
λ. Α similar prothesis sometimes takes place before a nasal:

phenomena is unknown; most of them must be due to the '

existence of syntaotioal doublets‚ but in certain cases the
