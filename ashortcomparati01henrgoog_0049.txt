out the whole eastern half of Europe by Russian and Polish, in
part of the south-east by the languages of the Sonth Slavonic
countries bordaring on Turkey or forming part of the Austrian
empire (Bulgarian, Semnan, (hostien, Slovenian‚ Bosnian‚ Dal-
matian, etc), and it even penetrates to Bohemia‚ right in the
contre of Europe (Ozech and Moravian). All the Slavonic
dialects have striking points of resemblance to one another,
which greatly facilitate their study.

(14) Before approaching the comparative study of Greek and
Latin, it seemed adviseble to assign them their proper place
in the family of languages to which they belong. But the con-
sideration of the various European and Asiatic languages
mentioned above does not fall within the narr'ow range of
the present work; at the most, they can only be occasionally
referred to for the sake of some simple and striking illus·

tration. Even the Hellenic and Italic dialeots oan only occupy
a very subordinate position in this grammar, which is ecn-
cerned primarily with the Greek κοινή and with classical Latin.

(15) The grammar of any single language, viewed by itself‚
includes four divisione: Phonology‚ or the study of sounds;
Etymology‚ or the study of the formation of worde; Mor-
phology, or the study of grammatioal forms (declension and
conjugation); and lastly Syntax‚ or the study of the way in
which these forms are employed and grouped together in son·
teuces, Such also are the objecta of comparative grammar,
and such ought to be the plan of this book. But comparative
syntax cannot yet be regarded as a science; and, moreover‚ a
complete treatment of it would require avolume as bulky as
the other three parts put together; hence it must be laid aeide
for the present. Moreover phonology, etymology, and morpho-
logy form a homogeneous whole, which can be treated quite
satisfactorily by itself.
