O.-Beiweeo a consonant ond vowel. Here the combinatione
are very varied, and we must confine ourselves to glanoing at
the most important.

(a) Nasal or liquid÷w: in Latin u or v alternating
according to laws not yet fully determined3 in Greek, according
to the dialect, f is assimilated, or lost with compensatory
lengthening, or lost without compensation: Lat. penda (kneeS,
also genua), Gk. *γόνΈ-ατα, whence AEol. γόννατα, Ion. γούνατα,
Att. γόνατα; Gk. *ficio-§¹(f0reigner), AEOL ξέννος, Dor. ξῆνος,
Ion. ξεῖνος, Aet. ξένος; Gk. *not-fd- (much), AEol. πόλλο-, Att.
πολλά, cf. Ion. πουλύ (Hom.); Gk. *cdl-fo· (whole), AEol. pro-
· bably timos, cf. Lat. sollus, solus, Ion. οὖλος, Att. eumn-n.
*aclwoa ef. Lat. sdtv0813 Gk. *triplo (maiden), Att. κόρη
(supra3'l).

(β) lc÷w=Gk ππ, iar-os (also lxx-oe); Lat. qu, equos,
where the u is treated neither as a vowel, in'asmuch as it does
not form a syllable, nor as a consonant, inasmuch as it does not
make the e long by position.

(y) t÷w: Gk. (Cretan) rfe' acone. “thee,'' Dor. τέ (simple

Ι loss), Ion-Art. eidone, cf. ricoape5=*rt'vfupts, Sk. calvcit'as

(iour); in Latin, w ie simply lost in te, but is vocalized in
quattuor, quatuor.

(δ) d÷w: Gk. *atis (twice), later δίς (cf. δώδεκα), which no
doubt stands ior *δδίς, if we may judge from the reduplication ’
in ἔδδεισεν (Hom.)=*e¹-dfea·<rtv, δέδδια (written beldia)=*bl.8fi-a,
both forms from the root dier (to sear) ; in Latin, vocalized in
duodecim (probably through the influence of the vocalism of
.duo=I.-E. *dou Gk. δύω), but generally dv, which becomes b,
brossdvis, bellum=*dvellum, ef. duellum, bonus=dvoous and
(arch.) doen-os. This change was late enough for the Latine
to retain the recollection of it up to the time of Varro.

(e) a÷w=in Greek of, if initial, infra 68, 2; when medial,
it becomes σσ, ἴσσος, ἴσος (equal)=flofoo, Sk. vlcvue (all); in
· 'latin sco becomes sd, recordandam, Sk. svdsor- (sister), of.

¹ lt is probable that sollus solvi, just like aena equi, and also deur divi. are
two cases belonging to the same deolension‚ which through analogy was
eplit up into two deolensions. For aolvt=*oolvi, cf. ³4 A α and ε, note.
