hence itis possible that ee-tio originally meant “you two are,'’
that this termination passed into the impf. erc-tio, and that
at length the duel was used with the function of the plural.¹
But it is also possible that the eudings *dee and '‘l-te stand to
one another in the same relation as *anea and ''l-dne, theone
being primary, the other secandary. Lastly, it is possible that
*tes and *ce formed a syntectical doublet.2 However this
inay be, the termination *aas is quite unknown to Greek, and
in Latin -te only occurs in the imperative.

3. The ending os the 3rd pl. was *cet after a vowel, *nt
after a consonant, whence in Greek -ν(τ) and -ev(r) respectively,
in Latin always -nt (except possibly erant for *er-ent=*esgit).³
The ending astera vowel is especially plain in the thematic
tenses, {pepon ἕ-φυγο-ν; tho vocalic ending efter a consonant
is most easily to be recognised in the sigmatic aorist, ἔλῦσαν for
*dicandi-lingit ;4 everywhere else, and even in thie case, it
has been corrupted or obscured by various accessory circum·
stannea.

A. At first sight, the ending of the sigmatic aorist and the
non-thematic aorist (after a consonant) seems to bea simple ν,
ἔλῦσα-ν, ἔχεα-ν; but this is a mere illusion, arising from the fact
that the person-sign α has been extended throughout the whole
inflexiones the aorist.⁵ The origin of this corruption is pro
bably due to the 3rd pers. pl. even more than to the lst sing:
the relation oi ἔλυον to ἐλύομεν caused ἐλύσαμεν to he produced
on the model of ἔλῦσαν; then the doublet *ἔλυσμεν ἐλύσαμεν gave
rise to a similar doublet *ἔλυστε ἐλύσατες at length the second
series of forms finally prevailed, and, on the analogy ei the
relation between ἐλύετε and ἔλυες, there were based on ἐλύσατε
the forms ἔλῦσας, ἐλύσατον, ε’λῦσάτην. The same process took
place in the optative of this aorist: lst sing. λύσεια-τ*λῠσειῃηῃ,
3rd pl. λύσειανε*λῦσειῃ-ῄί, whence the inflexion λύσειας, λῦσεία·
μεν, etc.
