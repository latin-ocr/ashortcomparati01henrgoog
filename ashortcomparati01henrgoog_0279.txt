9. &aivitiae—In Greek no peculiarity; -ostems rolo=*vdayo‚
-a-stcms, τᾶς, rim imparisyllabic stems, τιιι-ός.1 But in Latin
the genitive of the demonstrativos shows a special termination
oua, shortened lua, which is not found in any other language
and is most perplexing to the grammarian. Thefollowing is
the most probable explanation of its origin.

Let us take, for example, the form ejus. The demonstrative
root i, in its normal form and with the addition of the suffix -o,
may have produced a steni *eyo- *eo-, of which the nom-sing.
mascwould be *eu-c (cf. acc. caen) and the locative (used as geni-
tive)2 *et On the other hand, the same root, when itself acting
as stem, has a nom. sing. ia, of which the genitive would natu-
rally be *ios *i-us (cf. potr-uc).³ Let us suppose now that
these two synonymous forms were linked together by a sort of
pleonasm which is very common in all languages; this would
give the combination *ot ius, the transitiones which to ejus
(often written elicta) is easy to understand. In the same way,
to llcllo, roste, ²¹1‘quot the regular genitivos of the prononns ille,
iste, qut, ete, was attached the same genitive *ius of the
pronoun is; whence the pleonastic forms illius, istius, quotus
(Ep. scip), in which the accentuation illius and not lithos,4
recorded by Martianus (lapella, seems tc point to an old con-
traction from l‘illi ius. x

Are there any direct proofs in favour oi this ingenious
hypothesis? Nc, but indirect proofs are abundant. In the
first place, it is certain that the genitivos in -ῑ- (fem. oe) existed
in the de1nonstratives; they are found occasionally in the
comio poete, eg. istomodo, aliae rei in Lucretius. As to *ius²
F. Meunier has thought himself justified in reading it in a
verse of Plautus, where it is supported by the reading of two
manuscripts.⁶ Lastly‚ nothing is more inlharmony with the
genius of popular language than pronominal pleonasm 3 we have

only to compare, in vulgar French‚ the phrases, “ l'homme qu’il
vient, cet homme que tu lui aspris eoo couteau,” and in German
