As a general rule, formed by the mere addition oi the euffix
-έναι to the stem of the indicative, whatever thie may be,
λελοιπέναι, λελυκέναι.1 Some dialecto (Lech, Dor.) have a the·
matio infinitivo, γεγόνειν, δεδύκειν, which must be compared with
λελύκω and λελθκοιμι.

In Latin cidisse, legisse, dioecese, with no etymological con-
nexion with the Greek form² ⁴

Π. Meldia—The ending ie -θαι, and analogically -σθαι, as
in the 2nd pl. indicative -θε and-065³ λελέχθαι, λελεῖφθαι,-
δεδόσθαι, λελύσθαι In Latin, a periphrastic infinitivo lectam
esse.

(297) Ι. dolica-The root ie regularly in the vvcak form
before the suffix -Ὲώς (dail in a certain number ol Homeric and
ι classical perfect participles: εἰδώςε*έε-έιδ-ώς, as contrasted with
οἶδα; εἰκός ἐστιν (it is likely)= *faita-dr, as contrasted with ἔοικα ;
Eordaia, fem. έσταϋῖα; γεγαώςτ*γε-γῃ-έώς (γέ-γον-α), μεμαώςΞ
*pepp-fois (με’-μον-α), and even, through analogy, γεγαῦἳα, μεμαΰῖα,

ie simply added to the stem oi the indicative, γεγονώς, λελοιπώς,
λελυκώς, πεφιληκώς. The Attic femininos ἑστῶσα, γεγῶσα are
new formatione modelled on τῐμῶσα.

Latin has no formation 'oi this kind; it supplies its place by
the verbal in -to, in all middle verbe, cecatus (having followed),
and sometime, though very rarely, even in active verba, coactus
(having dined)‚ otherwise, by a periphrasis,

ΙΙ. Meldia-The suffix -μένο- ie added to the stem oi the
indicative: τετραμμένος, λελεγμένος, λελειμμένος, λελυμένος,
έσχισμένος.

Latin supplies its place by lectus, lictus, scissus, etc.
