3. Accusative: on, whence Gk. ·v‚ Lat. aa, presenting no
difficulty: ἵππω-ν, carrd-m, in old Latin written without m,
OINO.

4. Ablative (lh—The termination of this ablativo was ad
preceded by a vowel the nature of which cannot easily be
determined‚ probably '‘i-cd. But the vowel matters little here,
since from the pro-ethnio period it was contracted with the
final vowel of the stem.. The latter vowel being an ὅ, the oon·
traction necessarily produced *ἴππωδ, equod. 111 Latin this
ablativo has remained, regularly losing its final d, which is no
longer found except in old inscriptions.1 In Greek it has dis-
appeared from declension‚ but it reappears in tha shape of an
adverb in οὕτω, ἅνω, κάτω, ἀνωτέρω, etc, and especially, with a
final ς of somewhat obscure origin,53 in the numerous adverbs
derived from adjectives in ο-ς, οὕτως (doublet of οὕτω), σοφῶς,
καλῶς, κούφως, otc. It is adverbial also in Latin in certo,
citoss

It is also possible that this termination f-l‘d might be pre·
ceded by the thematic vowel ἔ-; in this case, the contraction
of the group would have given long ἒ, which is found only in
Latin, but immensely extended‚ since it there corresponds in
the formation of adverbs to the final ως of Greek: certe =
*certech focilatam probe, docte, baad, mdc, etc.

5. Abiolica (dl—The Sanskrit ablative dqut, which corras-
ponds to equod, may always be replaced by an ablativa opra-
tas‚ the termination of which reappears in a purer form in
Greek and Latin tos. But Latin alone adds it to sorno sterne
in o·, suaditca=¹⁸fcade=toc (from the bottom, from top to
bottom), perri-tus (from the bottom‚ thoroughly, cf. penu-s,
nomin, the meaning of which must have been modified). In
Greek it is no longer found except in a few adverbs‚ e'vaerds:
ira-tus, ἐκωός, which wore ao little understood to be ablativos

taenararcomauum de &cohortandam-The Oeoan ompmfid=improbc,
the termination ol which recalls that of the ablativos of the 3rd declension,
curro, cumaeae, has lad sorno to suppose an intrusion of the forms of the
3rd deoleneion into the domain of the let. But the conjecture stated in the
text seems more probable.
