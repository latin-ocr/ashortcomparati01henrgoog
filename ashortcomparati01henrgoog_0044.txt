cf. Lat. stare) is represented in Doric by ἴστᾶμι, in the Ionic-
· Attia group by ἵστημι.1 ,

Ι will mention briefly the dialects which belong to these two
groups, and their chief surviving monuments.

(8) A.-The Non-Ionic group comprises:

(a) The Doric dialects, of which literature furnishes some
, specimens, necessarily more or less corrupt, in theodos of
Pindar, the fragments of Alcman (Laconica) and other lyric
writers, the Idylls of Theocritus (Doric, of Sicily), and the
choruses of Greek tragic and comio poets (very impure Doric).
These dialects are: (a) Laconian-stela of Damonon, etc,
various glossas in Hesychius ; still surviving in the dialect called
Tsaconian. (β) Dorio of Magna Graecia—tables of Heraclea.
l γ) Messenian-inscription oi Andania. (δ) Argiva. (ε) Corin-
thian. (ζ) Megarran. (η) Cretan, known mainly through the
long and very important inscription recently discovered, called
the Table of Gortyna. (θ) Doric of the islands (Rhodes, etc.).
(ι) Achaean.

(b) The dialects of Northern Graece, Phocion, Locrian,
AEtolian, Acarnanian, etc, which hed no influence on the
literary language of Graece.

(c) Thessalian: little known, some cuncus peculiarities.

(d) Elean: inscriptions of Olympia.

(e) Arcadian-Cypriam which a considerable amount of

epigraphical evidence (inscription of Tegea, Table of Idalium)
justifies us in regarding as a single dialect, in spite of the dis-
tance and geographical obstacles separating its two varieties.
(f) Pamphylian (Asia Minor) ι very little known.
(p) Lesbian, the language of the oldest lyric poets, Alcaeus
and Sappho: numerous testimonias of ancient grammarian&
(h) Boeotian, which seems to have some affinity to Lesbian.

o.’' Doric changes nothing; corresponding to Attic τίθημι, where the c is
