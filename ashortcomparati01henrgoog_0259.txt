languagrr, even Sanskrit: πόδ-ε, χεῖρ-ε, ἀνέρ-ε, etc. But its
existence is only established in the cese of a· few stema, and in
several itis only apparent3 thus τείχη, ἄστη (Att.) cannot be
contracted from *reipsa *dorca as it is taught by the ordinary
grammars, but aro plurale used as duals.

2. Oblique Oresa-Whatever may have been the original
termination of this case, it is evident that, if estem ἶππο gave

ἵπποιιν, a stem mit could scarcely give anything but *cotyla ,· ,

hence we must recognise in Hom. ποδ-οἳιν and Att. ποδοῖν an
analogical extensicn of the endings οιιν ow of the and deciension.

(206) HI. Pharai-1. Nomiaative-Vocctive masculine and
feminine: termination fea, retained in Greek, πόλειςεπόλε-ες,
ἰχθύ-ες, ἡδεῖς-τὴδέ-ες, πόδ-ες, sorpto-ee, πατέρ-ες, etc, Hence
we should expect in Latin *ped-ta=*ped·ds, which would be
confused with the gen. sing. Analogy gnarded against this
confusion: the i-stems regularly formed ovea (also written
cosia and ovis)=*ovdy-s³e‚ cf. πόλειςε*πόλε-ες, and this ending

—es became the regular termination of the 3rd decl, pedes, ι

hemia-eia, ferent-ts, patr-esst etc.

But what, then, is to be thought of molada? In any case
it cannot go back tc *manresa cf. sss-ea. Can it go back to
*mauu-ee? This is hardly possible, since satem has remained,
and *esea has become auis. It is much more likely that tracuus
is an accusative plural used as nominative. It was easy for
aucha confusion to take place in Latin, where the· nom. and
acc. pl. of the 3rd decl. were to all outward appearance
identical.²

Gk. reiyw=vsixeu and κέρᾶ-τ*κέρασ-α, ἄστηΞ *dorsa Lat. qenes-a,
οιοοοῑο, ownia-aff etc. Here also the influence of the i-stems

¹ Thus pedes: parthenos: ovs. It will be seen that the identification oi
these two classes of stema, starting from a single point, was extended to all
with logical strictness. The short quantity is be'isved to appear in turbinis
audyorss (Plaut. Triviam. 835, Stich. 311).
. ² Thus sacaria (nom.) : antarta (asclepiadea (nom.) :pedes (acc).

³ In those casea where the Latin termination a appears as long, cy. the
Saturnian line asora perficit tus at asserit omnia brevia (Ep. Scipi, we must
suppose that the lengthening is due to the analogy of the originally long
final vowel oi the 2nd decl, jussi, cf. supra 190, 2. It was this lengthening‚
which certainly existed sporadically, that in this particular instance kept
