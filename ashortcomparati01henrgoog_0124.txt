ἀφῐκόμην, The detailed investigation of hiatus and elision
belongs to the study of Greek prosody; it will be sufficient here
to state that in the current pronunciation elision certainly
took place in many cases where it was not indicated in writing.l

Muoh more is this the case in Latin, which never indicates
elision in writing, but in practice observes it so strictly, that
the hiatus of a short or long vowel in Latin versification is
quite an exceptione] phenomenon.⁹ The present pronunciation
of Italian may give some idea of this melodious blending of a
final vowel with a following initial vowel.

, (75) The quantity of vowels is very constant in Greek and
Latin, especially it we take into account the artificial character
of the classifioation of all syllables into two classes, and no
more. For it is clear (supra 20, 4) that the degrees oi length
and shortness must really be very numerous, and that hence
a long vowel which is* equivalent, for example, to a short
vowel and a half might in versification, at the option of the
· writer, be treated either as long or short. The delicate appli-

cafations of this fundamental principle belong to the sphera
o prosody.
