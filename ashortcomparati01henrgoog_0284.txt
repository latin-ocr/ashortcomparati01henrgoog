recucurrit nnctnwsmr. Ἴ 245

(through intrusion of the vowel of i·s)‚¹ eae, ea ; aco. eos, eds, ea;
dat-abl, (ets) its; gen. ababuc, aarum.

2. Hic—To the demonstrative stem ho-is added in declan-
sion an indeclinable particle -oe‚ syncopated to ·c; all the cases
do not take it; but newertheless it is capable oi being added,
under one of these forms, to the majority of demonstrative
words.²-Sing.: nom. hic, baec, hbe (the ο is long only by
position, the true spelling would be *becc=h6d-ce); acc. huo-c
:llbdm-c, han-c, hom abl. hoc, bet-c: dat. hut-c and gen.
hujus, probably influenced by the vocalism of cut and cajus
(infra).-Pl.: nom. lu, hae, bue-c; acc. hos, hus, buec; dat-abl.
bts; gen. horum, bct-rum.

3. Ista-This word is probably a combination of the two
stcms i· and to, and hence ought to be declined: nom. masc.
*ts ttae, fem. *ea ta, acc. *eam taam;' but the element is has
ceased to be declined-Sing: nom. istus (arch.) and iste, ista,
istud3 acc. istum, istum, istud3 abl. iste, ista ; dat. isti; gen.
istiusdem ius.-Plur.: nom. ista, istae, ista (and istaec on the
analogy of baec); acc. ictos, etc.

4. Oliba-This archaic pronoun, of which numerous forms
are found in old Latin and the dative olli even in Vergil,
ought probably to be written olus, if we may judge from the
adverbial form olim (formerly) ; but its etymology is unknown.
The spelling with ll is due to the analogy of the following
word, of which it seemed to be merely a doublet.

ὅ. Illa-The declension is exactly the same as that of iste.

6. essum, whence idem, pronoun denoting identity.—In
formation it is to be compared with ὅ-δε; the pronoun is declined
and the particle added always remains unchanged. The
genitive ejusdem for *ejudem is due to the analogy of ejus, of.
caJusdam, etc.

7. Ipsa-This pronoun likewise contains an indeclinable
particle -pse and ought to be declined *is-pse, eapse, *ipse
:bama aee. *eum-pse, etc. Some of these forms exist as
archaisms‚ and the abl. fem. sing. eapse survived even to the

¹ And to dissimilute it from the dat. sing.
flag. bujeuce and even lwcce where the particle occurs twice over. ¹also

istu, illic, etc.
