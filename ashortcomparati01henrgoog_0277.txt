(216) Among the stems which follow the pronominal declen-
sion two classes are to be distinguished, the, demonstratives
and the personal pronouns. The essential characteristic of
the demonstratives is that they have a‘system of inflexion which
agrees much more nearly with the nominal deolension than with
that of pronouns proper3 they also vary according to the gender
of the object designated, whereas the personal pronouns have
only a single form for masculine, feminine, and neuterz ὁὴ τό,
hut ἐγώ for all three genders.

(217) I. Singulae-1. Nominutivc.—Greelr always has thr
ordinary -r; the feminine forms have no termination, as is
also the case with the masculine of the stem ὁ. Latin has
as many as three masculine terminatione: (1) -s, i-s, qui-s,
etc.; (2) short c, with no further termination (still rather
obscure), istc, tlte31(3) t, which appears to be equivalent
to οἱ and which is almost equally obscure3l hcc, qut The

feminine has the ordinary ending ct; but the stems which have
inthe masc. ΗΜ, have in the fem. aedat, hoe-c, qaue.

The nom-aco. neuter hasa special form, the same in both
languages: its termination is d, Greek redata, of. Latin
istud=*istod, ἄλλο aliud, τί quid, etc.
