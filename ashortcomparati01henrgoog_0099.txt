others, and yet, in the time of Quintilian, the pronunciation
of φ was still very different from that ci s.¹ This is proved
also by the fact that the Latina never transliterated it by f;
having nc voieeless aspirates, they simply used the unaspirated
voieeless consonante in those Greek words which they bor·
rowed, ΑοίῑέεεἈχιλλής, Ceriale (Tab. Mamm.)= Κορίνθῳ,
purpura=ropodpd; afterwards, aiming at greater precision,
they wrote ct, tt, pa, which however does not imply that they
pronounced the h. In fact, one of the chief mistakes of the
“barbariam'' who mispronounoed Greek consisted in not
aspirating the aspiratos, and Aristophanes delights to ridicule
this tendency of theirs, when he brings them on the stagel
This mispronunciation would be inconceivable if the pronun-
ciation of the aspirated had been quite different from that of
the unaspirated consonants. Lastly, combinatione like ἀφ’ οὗ
τάπ’ οὗ evidently require the pronunciation ap’ hal, and the
group φσ is written ψ, just like πσ.

These remarks do not exclude the possibility of particular
dialeots having treated the aspirates as spirante from ancient
times. Indead, we know that this was the case with θ in
Laconian: oads=deds, and μουσίδδει· λαλεῖ (Hesyeh.)= *μυθίζει

dental σ, cf Indo-Europeen origin3 the voioed dental ζ, pro-

nounced da, aa, ad according to the dialect, but always regarded ’“

tions; the voioed labial f, already studied as a semi-vowel. To
these may be added the sound h, represented by the rough

breathing.
