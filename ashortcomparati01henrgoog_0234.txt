the borrowing was aided by the analogy of the termination ay
oi the lst declension, ταὶ κεφαλαί, which was comparatively
regular.¹ Latin also had anem. pl. in aa, -ts, -ec'a, magistr-ec,
etc, attested bya good many inscriptions oi the eth century
of Rome; this was evidently borrowed from the 3rd declension
(cf. patrea from pater, and magister), and did not pass into the
classical language.

2. declarativa—The termination of the acc. pl. is always
*-os,² hence *inova *eqeb-as. We still find τόνς, ἐλευθέρονς,
etc, in Orotan and Argiva inscriptions. Everywhcre else the
phonetic changes already explained³ took place: Lesb. ἵπποις,
Dor. Bceot. ἵππως, lora-Ate. ἵππους, Lat. equos. The type with a
short vowel, τὸς θεός, etc, which is common in inscriptions and
in the Dorio of Theocritus, comes from syntactical positions in
which the v was dropped without any compensatory lengthen-
ing, eg. τὸς θεὸς σέβομαι, but σέβομαι τὸς θεούς, and has thence
been extended by analogy to other positione.

3. Instrumeotol.⁴—The case in -φι -φιν is in Homer instru-

mental plural as well as singular: θεά-φιν (with the gods),
ὀστεό·φιν (by the bones), etc.
. 4. Detive-Ablatice.⁵-The original form oi this case is re-
vealed to us by that which in Sanskrit serves as instrumental,
coccis, hence *ἵππωις *equata in other words, it is the form of
the dative singular with the addition of the s of the plural,
then, bya regular process of shortening,⁶ ἵπποις, equis=*equois.
The type equolawhich is very common, is only another spelling
of the same form.

t. meritive-The pro-ethnic termination of this case was
*aa in all declensions. In this particular declension it was
added to the stem, not directly, but by means cf a semi-vocalic
epenthesis, viz. y, the precise origin of which is unknown; hence,
instead of *eloco-au, the Indo-European form would be *charoy-
