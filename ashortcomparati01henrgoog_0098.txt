CONSONANTS.

⁷ (53) Ae several consonante which were originally explo-

all to take a general view of the consonante in each language.

ἓ 1. Greek.

(54) amploctere-Greek has nine explosives: namely‚ in
each of the three classes (guttural² dental‚ labial)‚ one voioed,
one voiceleee, and one voiceleee aspirato: γ, κ, χ-δ, τ, θ-
β, π, φ. The three voioed consonante have, in modern Greek,
become spirante (corresponding to p, English soit ta, and o);
but hardly any one denies that, in ancient Greek, they were
pronounced like p, d, b, though this statement does not exclude
the possibility of dialectica] variatione. The pronunciation of
the voiceleee consonante, lo, t, p, presente no difficulty.

The aspiratae are now only spirante (corresponding to Germ.
ch, English hard ta, and f), and we aleo have become aocustomed
to pronounee φ as f. This pronunciation however is incorrect‚
and we must beware ol transferring to ancient Greek the
modern pronunciation of the aspirates3 ior everything tende
to show thot χ, θ, φ, were really voiceleee aspiratee3 that is to
say, κ, τ, π, followed by h, as they are actually represented in '
those inscriptions in which H denotas the rough breathing‚ KH,
ΠΗ. It was only in very late Greek that the aspirata absorbed
the explosi ve preceding it and ooalesced with it into a spirant 3

the change took place sooner in the caseos φ than of the
