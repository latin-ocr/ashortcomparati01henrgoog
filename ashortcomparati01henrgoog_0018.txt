Aurnoa’s crasson.

rme book contains the substance of four years‘ lecturos
(1884-87), delivered on behalf of the Faculty of Letters oi'
Douai. More than once, in the course of my lecturos, Ι have
had occasion to regret that the studente had not in their hands
some manual of comparative grammar, which might enable
them, either to review ideas which they had imperfectly
grasped, or· to acquire by themselves those points which the
abundance of material forced me to excludo from the year’s
course. They at any rate had the opportunity of procuring
the notes of preceding years; but even this precarious and
insufficient resource was lacking to teachers outside, who often,
for lack of books, treated wrongly or did not treat at all the
questions proposed for their study. For the German works,
in the first rank of which must be placed G. Meyer's Greek
Grammar, are scarcely accessible to most of them, and there is
no Frenoh work or translation which puts within their reach
the discoveries of the last ten years, which have been so fruitful
for this science.¹ All these consideratione, and, above all, the
kind encouragement of ΜΜ. Brdal and Bergaigne‚ have in·
duced me to attempt to fill up this gap. May the book, when
once it has seen the light, prove to be not unworthy of the
weloome that greeted it before its birth!

My main object being tc write an elementary work, Ihave
scrupulously avoided controversy. As a general rule, on each
question I have simply pointed out the solution which seems
tc me the best, without attacking, and sometimes without even
mentioning, the others that have been offered. Many serious

¹ Iexcept ol course the dictionary oi MM. Brdal aud Baihy, which is
not s grammar, and cannot take the place ol one, and the second edition ol

Μ. S. Reinach's Manual (vol. ii), in which comparative grammar naturally
occupies only a limited space.
