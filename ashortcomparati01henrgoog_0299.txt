The usagain this respect is as follows, Homer and his
imitators use an unlimited lieense; almost the same is the ease
with the elegiae and lyrie poets; by the iambie, and especially
the tragie poets, the augment is rarely omitted, except by
the latter in choruses, lyric pieees, and the narratives of
messengers, which always have a certain amount of spic
eolouring3 in the prose of Herodotus, the augment is only
absent in iterative verbs;1 lastly, in classica] prose, the
augment has definitely gained the day, and, apart from the
aforesaid irregularities of the temporal augment, is never
absent except occasionally in the pluperfeet; moreover it is not
certain that even this was allowed in good Attio.

In Latin, on the contrary, it was the opposite analogy which
prevailed; as far as we can go back, there is no longer a trace
of any augmented form, and even the imperfect eram shows a
short vowel, as contrasted with the long vowel of ipa!

(236) Thcugh originally distinct from it, the augment ean
only be placed immediately before the verb; hence in simple
combinations of a particle and a verb the augment is inserted
between these two elements, διαβαίνω διέβαινον, περιγίγνομαι
περιεγένετο, ete. If however the verbis derived from a com-
pound and se forms an inseparable whole, the augment is
put at the beginning: ἀμφισβητέω (to dispute) ἠμφισβήτησα,
ἄντιδικέω (to defend a suit against) ἠντιδίκουν.3

But it was inevitable that seme confusion should arise .

between these two classes of words, which in many cases could
scarcely be distinguished except by the etymologist. Thus
sometimes the partiele seemed to form part of the body of the
verb and en that account received the augment, especially
when the verbal whole thus formed differed greatly from
the simple verb in meaning, asin the ease of ἐπίσταμαι (Ι
know), which no longer retained in any degree the meaning
· of ἵστημι; hence the imperfect ἠπιστάμην, and similarly in
