oeildeboeuf (bull's eye, round window), arc-ca-ciel (rainbow),
tete-otest, also Fere-Dieuffiorpus Christi), littei-Diem (hospital),
Pcat-Oise, etc, in which the last term is a genitive.1 But
they are especially abundant in Greek, where nearly all the
cases supply their contingent: gen. sing. Διόσ-κουροι (Castor
and Pollux), redo-oum (docks); loc. sing. odor-oropor (wayfarer),
Ἀλκί-νοος (Homeric proper name, cf. the Homeric phrase ἀλκὶ
πεποιθώς, “ confident in his strength”), ὁλι-πλόο-(ς (sailing on the
sea), whence by analogy forms like &hrodppvpor (of sea-purple);
acc. sing. ‹tropei-xlmas (celebrated), for it is clear that a syntac-
tical phrase ὄνομα κλυτός is the exact equivalent of πόδας ὠκύς;
loc. pl. dpeootyrvois (born in the mountains), ‹iperi-spodos (reared
in the mountains), Ναυσι-κάᾶ (proper name, meaning of last
term uncertain), instr. sing. or pl. Ἰφι·κράτ-ης (proper name),
'loti-dvocoa (proper name), where tuias-a means “with
force,” this word however being so litt-le understood by the
Greeks asa case-form that they derived an adjective from it Ι

(ἴφια μῆλα, “ fat sheep ”) as early as the time of Homor; per·
· haps also xahxi'rluror (forged out of copper)=*)(o>cmi ἐλατός (P),

διφρήλατος (borne on a car), eta, in which we might recognise
instrumentals in -ιῑ,2

It will bc enough here to point out that syntectical com·
position really depends upon syntax, and that we shall only
bc concerned with non-syntectical composition. Sometimes
the whole problem is to know which we are dealing with in a
given case; thus ‘Alimoor seems non-syntectical, but may very
possibly be a corruption of the syntectical Ἃλόννησος, which
likewise exists3 on the other hand ὀνομάκλυτος is explaiuable
as a syntactioel form, but it is also possible that it contains
the pure stem ὅνο-μα- with suffix auga-,³ and to this primitive
difference perhaps may be attributed the different accentua-
tions ὀνομάκλυτος and ὀνομακλυτός.

¹ resta Dec, hospitale Dea· at the period to which these words goboch
the nominative was Dira.
’ ² cf. iufra 187, 7.

⁸ Gt. supro 115, a-Tho Latin type triumvir is curicus3 it crisos homa
syntecticul phrase like magistratus trium virorum, from which were iormed
successively enom. pl. triumviri (ior tres virt) and a nom. sing. triumvir.
