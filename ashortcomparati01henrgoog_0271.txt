nominative has spread to the other cases in a few Homeris
forms, γεγαῶτ-ος, μεμαῶτ·ο,Ι the Attio ἔστᾶπα is a contracted
form of Ion. ἔστεῶτ-ιι = *ἔστήοτ-α.

VI. &marciliaco-Greek has two stenae: one ending in a
nasal, which has passed from the nom. sing. to all the other
casea, μείζων μεῖζον μείζονος ; the other sigmatic, no longer ap-

·pearing except in acc. sing. and nom-acc. pl, but in these cases
preferred in classical Greek to the nasal stem: acc. sing.

pre-historic times the w was liable to disappear under certain
ill-defined conditione, cf. Lat. dica, the declension of which is
analogical.⁴ The gradation is still very plain in the Greek
declension: nom. z÷a=rzao=rnyaae and Ζή-ς (dialectical)

critue)=die-m; loc. Διί :hri-i ; gen. Ar69=hrf-6e=*diw·os with
, reduction of the stem-syllable -οοο, This primitive declcnsion
was liable‚ in the various dialects, to all kinds of corruptione,
the two most important oi which are also classical: on the one

hand, Διός Διί gave rise to an acc. Δία, the ordinary form in
nse3 on the other, the acc. Ζῆν, being in its turn declined as ii

there is no similar case of loss ol mediol ν.
⁸ The acc. μείζους cannot be contracted from *μείζοαο The assimilation

here is ducto the neuter, where the two cases are, quite regularly, identical.
