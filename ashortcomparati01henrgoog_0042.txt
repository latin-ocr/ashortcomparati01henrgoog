by a tribe about which we do not know enough even to say
precisely where it originally lived. This pro-ethnic language,
which can only be restored by acomparison of the different
grammatical forms which have sprung from it, has received
the conventional name of the common Indo-European
language or Parenespooch}

(3) The Indo-European family comprises, in the first place,
two main divisions: an Asiagic or Aryan branch‚ anda
Europ-eju branch. The essential mark of distinction be-
tweon' these two groups lies in the fact that proethnic e ando
were preserved without corruption in the European languages,
whereas in the Asiatic languages they were both confused with
long or short a. Thus the primitive *bhdromes (we bear) is
represented very exactly by the Greek φέρομες (Dorio), but very
imperfectly by the Sanskrit bhdrdmas.

(4) I.-The Asiatic branch in its turn is divided into two

groups: ,
1. Indian group, oomprising (α) Sanskrit, which has long
been a dead language, but is still preserved with jealous care
in the liturgical schools of the Brahmans, and was early analysed
by the most minute grammarians that any literature has ever
known. Its oldest remains (certain hymns of the Veda) may go
back tothe tenth century aa, or even earlier. (β) Prakrit, or
more accurately the Prakritic languages, consisting cf popular
dialects which, many centurias before our era, superseded
Sanskrit in every-day life. The best known of these is Pali,
the sacred language of Buddhism. (γ) The modern dialects,
still spoken in many parts of India, such as Hindi, Hindustani,
Bengali, eto.

(5) 2. Iranian group, oomprising (α) Zend or Avestic,
certainly as old as Sanskrit, preserved in the Avesta and other
sacred books attributed to the legislator Zoroaster, the mythical
founder of fire worship. (β) Old Persian, the lauguage of the
losers of Marathon, oi which only a few scanty relies survive
in some cuneiform inscriptions of the Achaemenid kings. (y)
