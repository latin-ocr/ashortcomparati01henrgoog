PHONOLOGY.

(16) By Graeco-Latin phonology is meant the study of
the Greek and Latin sounds,¹ and of their regular
relations to one another.

The first thing necessary, in order to obtain an accurate view
ol the sounds 11 alanguage, is to think oi them as they are or
were actually pronotmced, and not merely as they appear when
viewed through the distorting medium of writing. Writing,
even supposing it were strictly phonetic‚ must always be 1111111- t
what olumsy representation of the extremely delicate and varied
mechanism of human speech. But, as a matter 11 fact, writing
never is phonetic; for, being fixed at atime when a certain
pronunciation was current, the spelling remains unohanged long
after the pronunciation has been altered? For example, the
Eronoh word 111 seemsto contain a diphthong; and it does, but
not the one indicated hythe spelling, lor the word 11 not pro·
nounced loy, but 1111.3 In other words, the semivewel, which
is really not t but 111 precedes, instead of following, the prin·
cipal vowel, which is really noto but a. No representation
could be more inexact. In the word autre there is no diphthong
at all (the word having long ceased to be pronounced uwtre),

¹ [Here and in similer 11111 the author uses the word phontme, which
he prefers as being more definite than ‘¹ sound‚” tho word generally adopted
by English writers]

² Thus English was lormerly pronounced 11 it was written; but, while
many changes 11111 hoen made in its pronunciation, its spelling has re-
mained almost the 111111. Hence the result which is so confusing to the
beginner.

3’,1ε1111111111 j [or English y in ponder]; qunglish 111 [in wake] or
Eranoh 11111 out. These sounds 111 not 111111, but consonante.
