tivo, containing a short vowel, or perhaps the ablative, which
we are about to consider, confused with the accusative.

3. The Sanskrit ablativo mdt, todt would require in Greek
an ablativa *με’8, *fieb *σέέᾷ whence με’, σε’, ἔ, which are found
in the accusative. In Latin *med became med through the
analogy of the long vowel of the aco. ute, then the d was
dropped after a long vowel: me, te, ee. The last word, meaning ’
“by oneself‚ apart,'’ was afterwards used in the sense of “ with·
out ” (se dole, without fraud), and also as a verbal prefix, eg.
recedere, literally “to go by oneself‚” secernere, eelooere,
etc. But the primitive form with short vowel still survivee in
the disjunctive aed (but), literally “ this point being put on one
side, except that. . . .''

4. The ablativo in -θεν needs no explanation.1

5. The terminationes the Greek dative is -oi' : lst pers. ε’μ-οί
and enclitic μ-οί. The 2nd person was already *toy in Indo·
European (Sk. te), which explains the fact that, even in Ionic-
Attic, the non-assibilated form τοι occure as an expletive
particle; hence σοί, like σύ, is analogical. In the 3rd person
οἶτ-*σῈ-οἳ (Lesb. foi), and {cistae-oi perhaps on the analogy ·
of the strong cases.

6. 'Phe Latin dative corresponds to the Sanskrit form
mei-lipom, tethbyam. But the correspondence is incomplete;
itis probable that the Latin termination was assimilated to
that ol the nominal dative (putet). The law regulating iambic
words allowed the scansion mitt, titt, aiot, which was sanctioned
by the classical language.

7. We have treated as a locutive the case in -ιν, which might
likewise, however, he regarded as an instrumental,a dative,
or even an accusative. It is certain that it is often used as an
accusative, probably on account of its final nasal. The forms
ἐμίν and τίν are Dorio, end are especially common in Theocritus 3⁹
we find reindui-iv in Homer (Il. xi. 201), ftv=*ef-tv in Cretan
, inscriptions ; the forms ἵν and sedeat rest almost entirely
on the evidence of the grammarians. But, as a substitute for
ἵν (him), -we very often find, with a dative or accusative iunctior,

l lhiilulll’rssiuo very often uses the noni. sing. τύ as an accusative.
