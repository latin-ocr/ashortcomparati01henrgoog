unknown, whereas the latter hardly ever tolerates hiatus.
Between these two dialeets, but somewhat nearer to Ionic,
come AEolic and Dorio, which allow hiatus in certain cases,
but require contraction in others. But, even when contrac-
, tion takes place in all the dialects, the sound resulting from
contraction may be different in each. - To avoid unduly com·
plicating this subject, we shall examine here only the com-
munest cases of contractiori, classifying them according to the
character of the first of the two vowels in hiatus.

1. α. a÷a, a÷o become e: Hom. Ion. ἄτη (bane, curse)
:creditore for tdhisse, cf. αὖατά (Pind.); Abt. 'Adqu=’AOyvdd
='Adyva2'e; Att. τᾶλλαετὰ ἅλλα, etc. a÷< becomes Ion.1 and
Act. e, Dor. η; Att. τῐμᾶτεετῐμάετε, Dor. ὅρη (see)=dpue.
etl-ty becomes ᾶ, η; lom-Alb. τῐμᾶτε, Dor. τῐμῆτε--τῖμάητε (subj.).

‹al-t becomes ae: *utitis (child), Hom. πάϊς, then παῖς. c÷0
becomes Act. u,2 Dor. d: Att. τῐμῶμενετῐμάομεν. a ÷ ω becomes
w: Att. τῐμῶμενετῐμάωμεν. α-Ι-υ becomes av(but often the
hiatus remeius): δαυλός (thick, shaggy)=*daeh65=*bauoh6-s,
cf. δασύ-ς; αὐτόςεάΰτός (durae is found in an Ionic inscription).l

2. ᾱ. cvra, e÷o become 6³: Eub-Dor. γᾶ, Ion-Att. γῆε
ΞΝηᾰαεγιῑιια. ᾶψε becomes ᾶ, even in Dorio: ἅλιος (written
ἀέλιος, but the scansion shows the word is trisyllabic) in Pindar,
cf. Ion. ἠέλιος, Att. ἥλιος. ᾶψο, ᾶψω become Dor. e: genpl.
(Homer.) χωρᾶων, Dor. χωρᾶν. ᾶψι becomes ᾶι (ᾳ). ceo is
unimportant. ι

3. ε. <÷a becomes Att. η, but the hiatus often remeius in
Ionio: τείχηετείχεα. It must not be supposed that πόλεις
’ (acc. pl.)is contracted from πόλεας; in the nom. pl. neut. χρῦσᾶ
εχρύσεα the vocalism of the terminetion must have been in·
fluenced by that of the ordinary neuter terminatione in ἄ. εψᾶ
(very rare) often forms only one syllable, even when both vowels
are written :4 δωρεά is a dissyllable‚ but Att. yevcda trisyllable.
c÷e becomes Lesb. Dor. η, Ion-Act. ει (pronouneed c), φιλεῖτεε

¹Oiten not contracted. The curione Homer-ic type ὁράαν (to see)=
ὀράειν has not yet received any satisfactory explanation.

2The Homeris forme showing discessis, ay. βιοῶνται ior βιῶνται-
biduum (very common in Homer), must be put on the seme level as ὁράαν. ·

³ This combination oi course does not occur in Ionio.

⁴ In this case e becomes a semi-vowel, supra 20, 3.
