ASPIRA'PION AND DnnsPIRA'rION.

(78) 1. Greek. In modern Greek the rough brenthing is
still written, but no longer pronounced. Thcugh ancient
Greek had not yet arrived at this stage, it was already tend-
ing towards it, and certain dialects had actually reached it.
We know that in the prehistoric period media] aspiration had
disappeared.2 Initial aspiration, according to the grammarians‚
was no longer known to the AEolians3 they were deterreat,
substituting everywhere the soft for the rough breathing.
New Ionic does not go sc far3 but several substitutione, such
as odkos=dtoe‚ and combinatione like ἀπ’ οὗ, ἀπίκετο, show that
in it the rough breat thing was scarcely more than an ornamenta]
addition confined to writ ing.

Attio, on the other hand, seems to have had a slight ten·
dency to δασύνειν, and we find 1n it initial aspirations which
have no etymological Just tification: ερση (dew)=dpcny‚ ορος
(boundary)=Ion. οὖρος, ἕως (dawn)=Gk. ἠώς, etc. More em-
barrassing are the Panhellenic or almost Panhellenic rough
breathings found in ἔννὺμι εἵνῦμι (vestis), ἐσπέρᾱ (vesper), ἵππος
(conos), etc, and especially in all words beginning with v,
dorrpos=Sk titianas, ὕδωρ, cf. Sk. uddn- (water) and Lat. unda.
Sometimes analogy has been at work: thus ἡμεῖς certainly owes

its rough brenthing tc ὑμεῖς. But the very ease with which s

words take or, lose this symbol seems to show that from an
early period it had 110 phonetic value, or at any rate very
. htllelmtin. It had 110 doubt practically none at all in classica]
Latin. Media] n was certainly not pronounced; hence the
