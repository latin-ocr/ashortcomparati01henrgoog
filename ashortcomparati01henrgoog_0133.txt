In other respects the Greek dialects show the widest diver·

gencies in their accentuation. The two antipodes are AEolic
and Doric, which are so closely allied phonetically: AEolic
throws the accent as far back as possible in all words, ep.
sseoihevs=sscorhais, ἔρυθροςτέρυθρός, θῦμοςεθῦμός5 Dorio, on the
contrary, faithfully preserves the ¹original oxytone accent, Be-
tween these two dialects lie Ionio and Attio, which however
are much nearer to Dorio than to AEolic. But all the dialects,
including Dorio, observe the rule that, in those forms of the
verb which are capable of beingeonjugated,1 the accent goes
back as far as possible. This nniform law, to which the only
exceptione are the two encliticS, εἰμί and φημί, and a few aorist
imperatives, εἰπέ, ἰδέ, λαβέ, ἐλθέ, is a legacy from the Indo-
European language, in which the verb in a principal sentence
was enclitio and entirely unacoented; in Sanskrit it is still
accented only in subordinate sentences. Greek, in adapting
the verb to its trisyllabic law, gave it everywhere a uniform
accentuation.

When the tonic accent falls on a long syllable, it may be
ascending, that is, the roice may be raised while lingering on
the syllable, or descending, thetis, the syllable may be begun
on ahigh note and finished on a lower note. Such a distinction
is of course impossible in the case oi a short syllable. In
Greek, the raised pitch of a short syllable is indicated by the
acute accent, θῦμός, λόγος, ἔλεγε. The ascending accent is indi-
cated in the same way; but the descending accent has a special
sign, the circumflex. -Thus in τῖμῶμεν the accentuation of the ὣ
exactly reproduces the descending accent of the uncontracted
group άο of τῐμάομεν, just as in τῐμώμεθα the accentuation of
the ’ώ reproduces the ascending accent of the same group in
τῐμαόμεθα. ·

It follows from these definitions that from the point of view
of the trisyllabic law the circumflex on the penultimate is equi·

fixed when the metathesis oi quantity took place. On the other hand, in a
final syllable which is only long by position, the length influences the acute
vaccent, but not the circumflex3 hence we shall write σαρδόνυξ (sardonyx)
not *σάρδονυξ, but μῶνυξ (with uncloven hocf) not ’μώνυξ.
