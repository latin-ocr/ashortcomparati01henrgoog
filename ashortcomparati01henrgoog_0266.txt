t which is different in each language, but remains constant
u throughout in each, leads one to think of a declension with
kvowel-gradation, such as φέροντ-α, *φερέντ-ι, *mppr-ds. We
,seven find in the Dorio of Heraclea (Magna Graecia) such a loc.
,ph as πρᾶσσόντασσι, which is usually explained as a corruption

(210) Ι. Stoma in -en·, -men-.—There is a curione relic
oi a complete system of vowel-gradation in the deciension
(much mutilated, it is true) of *Ὲρήν (sheep), cf. Hom. πολύ-ρρηντ
nom, not used; acc. *Ὲρῆν-α, proved by the gloss of Hesychius
ῥᾶνα· ἄρνα, but changed to ἄρνα through the analogy of the
other cases3 loc. ‹ipa-{3 gen. epv-es=*fapv-6s=*fpv-6e with .
complete reduction of the stem. 'Phe corresponding loc. pl.

· would be *ipa-oi=*fpp·‹ri, and there are still traces of the
sonant nasal in the second α of ἅρνασι, which has however
been corrupted through the influence of ἀρνί.

While *ἱρήν has generalised the weak form, exactly the
opposite process has taken place in φρήν (diaphragm, heart,
mind) in which the middle grade has prevailed throughout;
acc. φρει-ιι, loe. φρεν-ί, gen. φρεν-ός for *depr-63, nom pl. φρέν·ες,
etc. Nevertheless φρασί (deppae) is still found in Pindar.
In ordinary Greek this φρασί became φρεσί through the in·
fluence of the loc. sing. φρενί.

Most of the stems in -en·, ancn- are declined like φρήν;
ἄρρην ἄρρεν-ος, ποιμήν saepiu-os, ele, end loe. pl. ποιμέσι1 instead
of *ποιμασίε*ποιμνῃ-σί, because of ποιμένι. Lestly, a still
further degree of corruption consists in the generalization oi'
the long vowel cf the nominative: λειχήν (eruption) λειχὴν-ος,
πευθήν (spy) πευθῆν-ος, loc. pl. λειχῆσι, πευθῆσι.

It is this last stage which is reached by Latin, with this
imitation, that, if Latin has the long vowel in the nominative,
it keeps it in all cases (lien tien-is), and, if the weak cases

¹ φρεσί, ποιμέσι cannot oi course go back to *oper-oi, ’παρέ-ιρι, which
would have become *ppetok *ποιμεΐσι . ·
