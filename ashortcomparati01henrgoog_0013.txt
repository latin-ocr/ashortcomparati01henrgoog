“In Prof. Henry's Prdoio we have a much needed work. The revo-
lution undergone by comparative philology during the last ten years has
made the old mannals obsolete‚ more especially those in whioh it was
called upon to explain the sounds and grammatiool forms of Greek and
Latin.

‘⁸ Prof. Henry has supplied an inoreasingly' felt want. The work oould
not have been undertaken by better hands. The author has himself
borne a prominent part in the researohes and discoveries of the last few
years, and his wide knowledge and sonnd judgment make his triticiam

of the theories of others exceptionally valnable.’¹-Prof. Saros in lle
“Acadmya’

“ No better introduction to classioal etymology than this has yet
appeared. Prof. Homy has the odpa‘ntage of writing in a langnage of
euch unrivolled lucidity‚ that 1ndt·the‚'1nost abstruse subjeots seem plain
and simple3 and he is himself a master in whose hands we may feel safe,
who is eonversant with the latest philologioal literature, and ean take a
connected view of his soienoe.”-C'Iaosical Review.
