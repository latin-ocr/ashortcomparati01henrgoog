This distinction between the circumflcx and acute, which
will be found discussed in more detail in grammars specially
devoted to Latin,l is furnished by the grammarians. But, if
it is not entirely artificial, it must at least have been compli-
cated by them with refinements borrowed from the Greek
theory. In particular, if the long final syllable of otae changes
the circumflex of etcum to an acute accent, we do not see
why the long final syllable of domino should not throw the
acute accent of domiuus on the penultimate.

However this may be, the distinction between the circumflcx
and acute is not taken into account at all in the very impor-
tant part played by accentuation in the formation of, the
Romanae languages.
¹ The unaccented words in Latin are essentially the sameas
in Greek; namely, enclitics, queat, quia 2ετις, επεέστί, etc.;
proclitics, all the propositione when they precede their object.
³ Besides these mutilated remains of the proethnic accentua-
tion, Latin possessos also two types of accentuation peculiar Α
to itself, both of which have had a certain amount of influence

’ citheron the phonetic system of Latin or on that of the

Romanos languages. (1) The first, which is very ancient, is
a purely expiratory accent, which always rested on the initial
syllable of each word; to it must be attributed wholly or
in part such cases of syncope as reppuli :tropepola such
weakenings as afficio=*ddfaci0, and many other phenomena
which accord ill with the principles of classioal accentuation.²⁴
(2) The second type, which was chiefly developed in popular
Latin and Latin of the decadence, is a secondary accent, which
fell upon a word at intervals of two syllables, starting from

¹ ef. Havet, drumm. Lat. p. 217.

² Of course not the interrogative, but st quis, ne quis, cto.

³01. supra 32 A β, 36 Β, etc. To thie cause also must be referred the
sporadic reduplication of the consonant at the end oi an initial syllable; eg.
Juppiter=Jopuer=Gh voc. Ζεῦ πάτερ (the true accentuation would be πατερ
euclide), praticor=quotaoa and the doublets capu (Fr. clive) cdppc (Fr.
coepe) all of which facts point toa short und shurp utteranee ol the vowel
ol this syllable. The phenomenon recurs in Italian, allodola (Fr. alatreta,
larii) =Lat claudula, and even in learned words, rettortca=rhttorica 'l'ho
initial accent is common to Latin and all the Italic languagea aud has left
its traces in many geographical names in modern Italy ς eg. Posaro= Umbr.
Pisaurum, not Eat. Piaadrum.
