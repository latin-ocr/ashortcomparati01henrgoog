has been analysed in detail in the investigation of primary end
secondary derivation. It only remains to consider the logical
grouping of these stems in the conjugational system, and the
regular variatione to which they are liable through the addition
of the person-endings.

As regards the first point, it will be remembered that many.
Latin tenses have in practical grammar a different name from
that which they have in comparative grammar, in other words,
that their ordinary fonction does not strictly oorrsspond to
their theoretical function. In the following account the Latin

tenses will appear under the Greek categories to which they
morphologioally correspond; but at the same time, under each
Greek tense, we shall mention the Latin tense having the same
iuuet-ion.

(269) The variation oi the conjugated stems in respect of
gradation may be summed up in two main lsws:

I. The non-thematio forms1are distinguished as strong or
wealr‚ according as the grado of the syllable immediately pre·
oeding the termination is normal (deflected in the perfect only}
or reduced: the strong form properly appears only in the
singular of the active, the weak form in the plural
and dual of the active and in the whole of the middle,
aq. τίθη-μι ride-per τίθε-μοιι.2

H. In the thematis forms the vowel clo, immediately pre-
ceding the termination‚ takes the form o in all the rst
persons and in the 3rd plural, but everywhere else the
form e: φέρω φέρο-μεν φέρο-ντι, φέρο-μαι φερό-μεθα (-μεθονῗ)
φέρο-νται; φέρεις φέρει φέρε-τε φέρε-τον, φέρε-αι φέρεηαι φέρε-σθε
φέρε-σθον.

The first law is very often interfered with in its applicatione
by analogy; in Latin, owing to the comparative rarity of the
non-thematic forms, only faint traces of it remain. On the
other hand, the second law is always observed in Greek, and
