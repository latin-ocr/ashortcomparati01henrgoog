sounds whose existence is more problematical, and which may ’
therefore be neglected, the IndoEuropean langnage possessed
only the two dental or sibilant spirante a and z. Moreover, as
the voiced spirant only arose through the assimilation of the
voiceless spirant to a following voiced consonant, they may
both be studied under the same heading, provided we bear
in mind that the groups σβ (σβέννῦμι), σγ (playa), οδ (always
in AEolic instead of ζ) are equivalent in pronunciation to ab,
ep ad.

’Tha treatment of the primitive sibilant varied considerably
according to its position.

51. Initial s.

(68) 1. Before u vowel. Sremains in Latin and becomes
h (rough breathing) in Greek: ἑπτά septem, ἕρπω serpo, ἕδος
sedeo, ἁπλόος1 simplem, eto. This law is most strictly ob
served. Initial σ in Greek always arises from an earlier
group of consonante, not from s. Thus, in the case of σεύω (to
put in motion)=*ooev'e (cf. aor. ε’-σσύ-μην), we must restore
1.-E. *pyra a form indicated by the sk. eya, in σέβ-ο-μοι (to

ew, cf. Germ. schwellee [Eng. ewell] 32 in σῦς (εονίιιθ)εὗς, Lat.
sats, the restoration of the o may be due to the oblique ceassiu
which it would be retained in old Greek, as, for example, in the
genitive *of-ds.

2. Before a semi-vowel. The initial groups ey (very rare)
and ew are changed to the rough breathing in Greek, ἔξεἯέξ
(six), the pronoun idoli, of. affarea, Lat. ecus, Sw must
have passed through the intermediate stage of wb, as is proved

by the spelling Ὲέξ found in inscriptions, and by the necessity
of reading fe‘ fot in many verses of Homer. In Latin, the
semi-vowel simply disappears, see, ειη cf. however supra 40 O ε.

3. Before α nasci or liquid. As ew becomes ech, so in
Greek er becomes rb, written ῥ; in Latin the group ar always

form σάλος could in any case he onlya syntectical doublet used alter avowel.
