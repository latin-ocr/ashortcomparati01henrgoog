2. The ending *si (Sk. ai) underwent more corruptions than
any other. Indead, it can scarcely be recognised at all.

A. Among the non-thematic forms, it is still recognisable:
in <i=*i‹n=Sk. dci (thou art), the relation of which to La.
osiaco-si (ci. Hom. ἐσ-σῦ can be easily perceived; in εἴ (thou
goest)=*ei-i=*ei-ot, sk. ἒ-ἔῑ ; perhaps in φῄ-ς, in which the ι

subscript, if not amere invention of the grammarians, can only Α

be explained by a form *φῄε*φηίε*φη-σί, with final ς added
as below. According to this we ought to have *τίθρρ *aaa

*deikvic=*ridn-or, *dido-oc, *dclxvii-ot, etc, cf. Sk. doda-si (thou · ’

givest); but we have instead τίθη-ς, δίδω-ς, δείκνῦ-ς, with an
obvious intrusiones the secandary ending.l The same phe·
nomenon naturally took place in Latin: cs=*cs·c, ts for *t-si =
*εἶ-σι, fer-s, cla-s, sta-s (ct-s is still unexplained).

B. In the thematic conjugation, the Sk. bhctra-si would corre-
spond to Greek *φέρε-σι, whence *φέρει Nothing like this is
found in the active; but in the middle we find, in Attio only, a
2nd sing. φέρει, λύει, as contrasted with φέρῃ, λύῃ2 of tho κοινὴ
and all the other dialects; and as there seems to be no phonetic
connexion possible between φέρῃ and φέρει, we may infer that
the latter is a regular form of the and sing. active, which
the Attics had kept, transferring it to the middle voice on ac-
count of its external resemblance to φέρῃ. The almost Pan·
hellenic form of and sing. active, φέρεις, λύεις, is evidently
corrupted3 it probably contains the primitive form, *φέρει
*λύει to which was added a secondary ending -ς, because the
signos the ind person was no longer perceptible. However
strange this process may seem, it appears historically proved
in the case of φῄς (capra), and it certainly is so in εἶς (thou
art, Hom, Herod.) and εἶς (thou goest), well authenticated
doublets of the regular εἶ. The subjunctive has φέρῃς, similarly

derived from the regular *digq=*pe'pace, or, more simply, .

modelled upon φέρεις, in accordance with the obvious analogy
by which ashort syllable in the indicative always correspondet}
to a long syllable in the subjunctive.
The form φέρες, λέγε-ς, which is given as Doric and is found
ι ¹ Thus τίθης : τίθετεεέτέθης : ἐτέθετε.
