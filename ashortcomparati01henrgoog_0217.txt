pounds formed from nominal stems sporadically introduces into ’
both classes the vowel o: λιπαναύτψς (a deserting sailor),
λιπό-φθογγος (without voice), movilium-s (cowardly)3 μιξο-
ssdpssapos(half·barbarian), tiderichovcswenturesome). Further,
through reciproca] analogy, we find (very rarely) ein the sig-
matic compounds, nepot-rolin (sacker of cities), and ι in the
non-sigmatic, ἀρχι-θάλασσψς (ruling the sea), ιῖιρχι-θέωρινς1 (chief
of the theeri), todi-ddoyyos (destroying speech), τερπικέραυνος-τ
*τρεπε-κέραυνος (fulmina torqueas), etc.

ξ 2-me of the luat term.

(181) As a general rule, when the last term ends in a vowel,
this is not changed in the formation cf Greek compoundS,
except that, if the compound is an adjective, it necessarily .
adapta itsels to the changes of gender of which it is susceptible :
θάνατος ἅ-θάνατψς (η, ο-ν),2 φλοῖσβος πολύ-φλοισβψς (ο-ν); κόμη
fundendae-s and also {codd-nonos, κεφαλή coheredum-33 πόλι-ς
περσέ-πολι-ς; δάκρυ volt-tannae. In Latin we have similarly
slavicorum, and aequinomi-s (a, u-rn) is declined like an
ostem3 but usually, in forming an adjective, Latin changes
the final vowel of the last term to an i, whence the common
type remus triremi-s, clivos declivi-s, omna-s (annus) sol-
lemni-a,³ forma informi-a, norma abnormi-s, anima semi-
animi-s, eto.

When it ends in a consonant, the ‘last term may undergo
no change, and this is usually the case in Latin: atnzglcc-a,
praecep-s, opi-fece, cupri-pec, bidan-s, quadri-frons etc. But
in Greek the treatment is much more varied :—(1) No change ε
τρί-που-ς, orl-{cys (ycke-fellcw), aid-orn (durh), eiuro (beautiful),
κολλί-θριξ, πολύ-χειρ. (2) Transition to the odeclension by the
addition of an o: ‹vd-(cyon,4 καλλίπριχος, πολύ-χειρο-ς, ὄ·πατρο-ς

¹ Possibly this ἀρχι-, which is so common, may have been, like άλκὶ, the
locative oi a lost nominal atem. cf. supro 176.
