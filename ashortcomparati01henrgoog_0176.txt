ἓ 2. Helleuic Formatioas.

(128) I. Stoma with suffla -Ρότ- (-f6‹r-): perfect participles.—

This formation is Indelluropean, but it has been lost in Latin
ι end greatly corrupted in Greek, so that the primitive form cf
‘the suffix, euos, can no longer be recognised except in the
nom. nent. in «ssd-fes, and in the feminine, where it is reduced
bo *ets- before the secondary suffix -l·, eg. clbviu=*fsrd-ilo-tu‚ cf.
Sk. vid-ast. Everywhere else the suffix lost itsf from the first,
no doubt on the analogy of the forms in which the f was dropped
as being intervocalic; thus *τε-θνρὶώς naturally became τεθνηὼς ;
but *eta-fois (likely) ought to have given *εῑττώςῙ whereas we
have εῑκ-ώς, based on a supposed suffix -ώς, Moreover, in the
oblique cases the syllable -fo'o- changed its σ for a τ of ob ,
scuro origin, due perhaps to the analogy of the participlesin-rr-‚
εἷδ-ότ-ος, etxodr-oe‚re-61›odr-0e(10n. With metathesis τε-θνε-ῶτ·ος),
etc, on the model of ῖδό-ντ-ος, etc.
(129) H. Stems with suffiae -ἅτ- (-ἅσ-). Itis impossible not

to connect with the preceding type the neuters in -ἄς, κέρας ’

(horn), γέρας (reward), γῆρας (old age), etc. For, on the one
hand, the oblique cases have a τ instead of σ, gen. κέρατ-ος; on
the other hand, they still show the presence of σ in the con-
tracted form κέρωςεκέροος, which cannot go back to κέρατος,
since intervocalic τ is not liable to be dropped, and must con-

* sequently go back to *κέρασ-ος. This being the case, and as
there are no materials for comparison outside Greek, the real
form of the suffix cannot be determined. What seems more¹
clear is an undoubted connexion of the stems in -ἄς with those
in -ος (-εσ-). Both are neuters, and throw the accent back as far
as possible ;2 moreover the forms κέρεα (horne), τείρεα (wonders)³
exist side by side with κέρατα, τέρατα, and certain words even,
like βρέτας (miraculous statue), οὖδας (ground), are declined only
like τεῖχος, eq. gen. βρέτεος, loc. οὔδει, erce
