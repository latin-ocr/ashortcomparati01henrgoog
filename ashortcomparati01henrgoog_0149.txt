πί-ππω (to fall), same root as πέτομαι (to fly); ἵζω (to seat)=
*σί-σὸ-ω, root sed in ἕδος and sed-dm ioxw=icxm¹=*oi-w)(·w

τίκτω, probably with metathesis for *τί-τκω (to bring forth,
cf. aor. πεκ-εἳν), eto.3 Latin: fi=9n=o=l⁸yiyv=e3 stataet-scca,
identical with ἵζω. ’
(91) XI. Stema with suffia -y0·: Greek and Latin pre-
sente—The primitive accentuation is not clearly known; it is
probable that the suffix ·yo- might sometimes take the accent,

sometimes leave it on the root. However that may bo, the v
root mostly appears in the weakened form, though forms with ξ
normal root, like πίλλω (to nise), στέλλω (to send), are not ;
very rare; sometimes we even find both forms as dialectical '
doublets: thus Dor. φθοίρω (to spoil)=*ddy-yu corresponds to ζ
AEol. φθέρρω and Ion. φθείρωε*φθέρ-ῃω. We know moreover ’
what a complicated series cf phonetic phencmena4 is produced y

in Greekbythe combinationes the initial letter of the suffix

. with the final letter of the root3 it will suffice to recall as ,ἶ
examples: βαίνω, ven-im σπείρω (to sow, cf. neapol), and οπ-ύοπ, ’

mor-iam ἅλλομαι (Ι leap) and salim στίζω (tc prick=*criy-yo)‚

μοι, of. λιταί (prayers); 1οοί1),τύππω and cap-ic. In certain ‘
cases, in consequence of the loss of intervocalic y, we should

be in danger, if not on our guard,.of confusing this class with ,
olassV13 thus φύω (Lesb. φυίω) contains the suffix -ῃο, not

merely the suffix -ο, as is shown at once by tha weak grado of
the radical syllable. So λύω, κλύω, etc.

(92) XII. Stoma with suffia -sk0-‚ root penerelly weck-
, eaed: Greek and Latin presente—This primary suffix is
pretty common: Gk. βοί-σκω (to welk), βλύσκω (to gc), θνή-σκω
