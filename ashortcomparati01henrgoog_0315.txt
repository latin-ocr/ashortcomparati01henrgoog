These two forms are the only regular forms oi the 2nd singu
of the perfect retained in Greek3 the c of the lst sing. and 3rd
plur. (λέλοιπε-α, >echols-cm) having become an integral part of
the stem, as in the sigmatic aorist,¹ the whole conjugation of
the perfect was bosedone false stem λέλοιπα-, to which was
simply added in the 2nd sing. the secondary and primary
termination -ς, λέλοιπα-ς, telvm-et In spite of, er rather from
the very fact of, its rarity‚ the termination -θσ spread outside
its proper sphere: ἢσ-θα, being no longer understood to be a
perfect, was taken for an imperfect, a mere doublet of ἢς; the
syllable -θσ was then regarded as an expletive suffix which
might optionally be added to all forms of the 2υθ sing, and
this illusion gave rise to such forms as τίθησθα (οθ. xxiv. 476),
ἔχεισθα, ἔφησθα, ᾔεισθα (Plato), ἐθέλῃσθα, βάλοισθα, εἴα, which
are found more or less in all dialeots, but especially in Homer.

In the dual and plural the terminatione are the same as in
the primary tenses:

termination is added to the false stem in -a-‚ λελοίπα-τσν,
