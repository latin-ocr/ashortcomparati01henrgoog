Muoh more rarely the root seems to be deflected, ap. τρώγ-(ο

(to gnaw), eor. ἔ-τραγ-οψ. Here it is the vocalism of the per· ¹

fect which contamimated that of the present, as may easily
be proved in the case of the typieal form yeydv-or (to cry),
which is modelled on the perfect γέ-γων-α, and shows, not only
its vocalism, but even its reduplication.

VII. Stems cuith suffic -e·s-o- primitively ooaccentecl:
Greek subjunetives.-Morphologieally this class does not differ
from the preceding one: crr'ropcv, used as a subjunctive, is
evidently framed in the same way as λέγ-ψμεν, which is used
as indicative3 but as the root στᾶ was capable of being eonju-
gated without an affix, its conjugation withan affix was utilized
to serve asa subjunctive. In other words, λέγ-ο-μεν would be a
subjunctive if there existed an indicative *liypul 'ro this class
belong allsubjunctives with a short vowel, present iope (let us
go), aorist βή-ο-μεν, στή-ο-μεν, dei-oper, perfect εἵδ-ο-μεν2 (Osmida), “
these forms were still fairly common in the language of Homer,
but were superseded in ordinary Greek by subjunctivae with a
long vowel. In Latin this type is unknown; from the mere
iaot that Latin no longer had any non-thematic indicativae, all
its thematis verbal forms were used as indicativus. Latin, how·
ever, still kept ero=*es-o=Gk. *io-o (ἔω, ὦ), a subjunctive used
as future.

tice lanqucye: non-thematie aorists (called in Greek second
. aorists).—-The root is weakened, as is shown hythe primitive
accentuation, which Greek faithiully preserved in the forms
incapable of conjugation, inf. φυγ-εῐν, part. φυγ-ών, cf. φεύγ-ειν
and φεύγ-ων. It is sufficient to enumerate λαβ-εῖν, hod-civ,
πτ-έ-σθαι (ef. the present triv-eodm), i-ox-o-rt (of. ἔχ·ω = *σε’χ-ω),
herr-civ, παθ-εῖν ( = *ηιθ-εἳν, cf. perf. πέ-πονθ-α), eie. Sometimes the

fer-s), with no affix but with reduplication ‘bloi-bberwi (ef. sk. mehor-mi, 1
carry), with affix -ηᾶ- *bbg-nd-mi, with effix mew- 'bbg-uew-ma', with effix
·e· (o) ’bier-e (φέρ-ω, sk. otor-dmi), or with effix -έ- (-ό-) *hir-e, ond so
on. Oi this original variety, which corresponded perhaps to different shades
oi present meaning (momentery, durotive, iteratim, etc), we should find in
each languuge only a few isolated exemplos, disjecta meruero verbi.
