TRANSLATOR'S PREFAOE.

Tun following work is a translation of Professor Victor
Henry’s Preeis de Grammatirc Comperta du Grec et du Latin.
The translation was undertaken by me mainly at the sugges·
tion of Professor Nettleship and Professor Sayce, and with the
full approval of the author, in the hope that, in the paucity of
English books containing the results of the latest researches in
Comparative Philology in regard to Greek and Latin, a trans·
lation of a work in which these were lucidly set forth by one
of the acknowledged masters of the science might be of use to
English studente.

The translation has been made from the second and re·

vised edition of the original. It contains also various later ’

corrections and additions by the author, ap. p. 119 note ·
(ἐγνώσθης), p. 131 (πειστήρ), etc.; some additions by the author
have also been inserted in the Bibliography. A few slight
modificatione and additions have been made, in order to adapt
the work more directly to the requirements of English studente.
Thus in the Bibliography, English translations of German books
have been substituted for French translations. Again‚ in the
original, the explanatione of pronunciation and illustratione of
phonetio phenomena were mainly given through the medium of
French examples; in a few such cases, mainly those connected
with pronunciation, English examples have been substituted
jointly by tha author and myself, ap. pp. 18, 21, etc.; in
others, at the author’s suggestion, I have added corresponding
English examples within square brackets, cp. pp. 30 note, 54
note, 185 note, etc. So also, when German words cognate to
Latin and Greek have been given as illustratione, the corre-
sponding English words have sometimes been added in brackets,
