from cupio, etc. But nothing is more doubtful than tno
pro-ethnic contraction of ea to e; and it is much better to see
in eye, sect, cept the normal form oi the roots which appear in
the reduced form in ayo, socie, capio ;ι more especially as the e
of the Latin perfect was also supported by the analogy of sedi,
vent?

(240) 111. Syllabic reduplicatioo before a vowel, often
wrongly called Attio reduplication, is more common in Homer
than the preceding kind, and is found in all dialects. It consiste
of the reduplication oi the entire initial syllable of the verb,
but with a short vowel, whereas the verbal syllable has along
vowel: dtr-unr-u, ὄλ-ωλ-α, ‹id-orda, ε’δ-ηδ-ώς (having baben), ἅρ-ᾶρ-(ι
ἅαήρ-αι (Ι have fitted), etc. These few radical formatione, which
’ were very simple and probably primitive, served as modale for
others of a more complicated character, such as ε’λ-ήλουθ-ιι (and
Horu. εἰλήλουθα, through a corruption), ἐγρ-ήγορ-α(116111ε’γεὶρω),
ἀκ-ήκο(1)-α, ε’ν·ήνοχ·α (root ἐνεκ, (11.1101. ἤνεγκον), ὀλ·ώλεκ-α (Ι have
caused to perish, 61.ὀλέ-κ-ω),ὀμ-ώμακ-α(116111 ὄμνῦμι, to swear,
fut. ὀμό-σω), etc.; and secundarily for actual barbarisms, in
which the entire termination was transferred from one of the
above forms, ey. ἐδήδοκα (Ι have caten, root ε’δ), ἀγήοχο (from
dyo), evidently modelled on ἐνήνοχα. This common mode oi
formationis confined to Greek.⁸

ξ 2. Uoc of Reduplication.

(241) There is no doubt that in Indo-European the re·
duplication was liable to disappear, probably under the same
conditions as the augment. There is even an unquestionable
instance of a perfect which must have entirely lost all reduplica-
tion in the pro-ethnic period, since there is no traco of it in
any languag03 viz. *noyon (Ι have seen, Ι know), sk. ved-a (Ι
know), Gk. οἶδ-α, Lat. eid-t, Goth. vuit (Germ. ich aoeies [Eng.
I well). But in Greek, the reduplication had already become
fixed in the Homeric period, just as was the case with the
augment in the classica] period, so that, apart from the
