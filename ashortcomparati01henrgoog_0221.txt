without any termination to 111 11 1 noun or verb.l ln short,
the 11111 11 almost an abstraction, like the root. But this fact
does not in the least invalidate the claims 11 morphology.
For 11 111 the word 111111 mainly an abstraction? Man thinks
and expresses his thoughts by means os sentences, not isolated
words.

Atthis point there arises a preliminary question. How is
it possible to conceive that a mere termination, almost always
monosyllabis, often reduced 11 1 single consonant, and some,
times invisible to any other eye but that 11 the philologist‚ should,
Ι when added 11 1111111111 11 verbal stem, have tha power 11 111-
troduoing into it a more or 1111 complicated modification 11
meaning, such 11 singular or plural, subject or object, lst, 2nd,
or 3rd person, eto? We may obtain, 11 111 1 solution of the
problem, at any 1111 1 hint towards its solution, from the lan·
guages called isolating or agglutinative, in which the 111111111

denotiug relation have not yet coalesced with the significant . ⁵

elementa. In Chinese, for example, the plural does not differ in
principle from the singular3 but, in cases where it is absolutely
indispensable to emphasize the notion 11 plurality, this may be
done by placing 11111 the noun another noun having the meaning
11 “crowd'’ or “universality,’' eg. tholey 111 kidi=yboenis
filias multitudo that 11 “ the youths.'' Suppose tici drops out
of use as a separate word, then only the history 11 the language
will be able to explain the plural meaning belonging to the
affix. Again, certain Finnish languages still havea word veli
(friend, companion)‚ which Hungarian, a language 11 the same
family, has entirely lost ; but Hungarian has kept in its (111111-
1111 11 affix ·vel witha comitative 11 instrumenta] meaning,
eg. haceldama-comes, “with the stone.’' Now, in accordance
with the law 11 vocalia harmony, which requires the partial
assimilation 11 the vowel of the suffix to that 11 the stem, this
syllable -vet often becomes -val, atys-vol (with the father); in
accordance with another law, theo 11 assimilated to the final

¹ There is scarcely anyinstanoe of the nominal stem free 11111 all
addition except in the vocative sing, tra-e, 111-ες 11 111111 verbal 111111,
except 1111111 2nd pers. sing. 11 1111111111111,λέγ-ε, lep-e. (The impera-
