§a 0000000.

(215) One 01 the 0000000001 10010000 01 both Greek and
Latin grammar is the existence 01 socalled heteroclite 00000,
the deolension oi which is based upon two 00 three different
010010, eq. γυνή γυναῖκτο wrcen-65, or, on ‘the other hand, senex*
, (=*seoec·s) eoo-em seo-is; and this well-known peculiarity
would scarcely call for anything beyond a reference 10 the
,practioal grammaire, but 100 the fact that certain heteroclite
noune form an important class, common to both languages, and
going back ultimately 1ο the parent speech. These nouns 000
the neuters in ’101111 Gk. -ap, -ωρ, Lat. -ar, which form their
oblique cases from a stem 1000, 10 which Greek has further
added a τ, which may be compared with that of words like
σώμαι-τος, 01. Lat. aeonia-tae so that, corresponding to Sk. ydkyt
(liver) gen. tycho-do, Greek has ἧπαρ ἥπατ-ος, Latin jer-ur
*jocio-is (the differenoe 01 quantity may be disregarded 100 our
present purpose). ρ

Greek has several examples 01 this kind 01 declension: ἧπαρ,
ἤπια-ος = *ἧπῃτ-ος; στέᾰρ (fat)=*orijiip, gen. στέᾶτοςτ10οήἄτ-οςᾗ
ὕδωρ, ebur-or, cf. Sk. addo, odo-ds, and Lat. 00010 where the

¹ πόλεις and πόλιας must be corrected to πολῖς 11. ii. 648, Od. viii. 560.
