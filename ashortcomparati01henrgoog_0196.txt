nominal stema in -rr-, ipsi-copon (active). From the last type
was formed the suffix epo with the same function, &diripe-c
(eatable), of which suffix the rare and obscure derivative
clement ·όλιμο-. seems to be only a particular variety, clidium-r
(beautiful).

(156) VI. Saffirr -men-, etc-The secondary suffixes -μα
and -μεν- form in Greek: (1) the numerous neuters in -μα,
roi-ppo (work, poem), πάθ-ψμα (suffering), ψήφισ-μα (decree),
corresponding to the Latin neuters in -owa, roy-immo, sol-d-
onea, and the subsidiary forms in amato, arm-conectam (2)
all the secondary AEolio infinitives in ·μεν and -μεν-αι, ay.
decl-per and pepi-perat, formed on the analogy of the prima-ry
forms στᾶ-μεν and δό-μεν-αι. It must be observed that before
the suffix -μεν- of the infinitiva the thematic vowel assumes the
form ε, whereas it takes the deflected form ‚before the almost
identical suffix -μενο- of the middle participle, φεράμενο-ς, Lat.
alumna-s (one who is nourished‚ nursling). The last forma·
tion, which is extensively represented in Greek, where it forms
the participles of all tenses in the mediopassive voice, is repre-
sented in Latin only by a few nominal stemsl in which the
suffixis rather -ocao- than onena, eg. Vertumnus (god of

spring)=*vertomwaos, he who returns (the year), autumnus
(an obscure formation); also by the 2nd pers. pl. of all tenses ¹
in the passive voice, icy-ionici, amamini, and by analogy
cord-bamini, audi-remini, etc. Δ

, (157) VII. Sacffim -ro-, -lo-.—This suffix is often secondary

in Greek, where it forms adjectiveS, 'usually oxytone: φανψράς
’ (evident), φοβ-εφίνς (terrible, cf. φόβ-ο-ς), ray-apte (strong),
σῐγ-η-λίνς, Dor. σῐγ-ᾱ-λό-ς’ (silent), from σῖγίᾖ (silence), etc.
From these types and others false suffixos were afterwards
detached, which became very widely extended, ay. dupla)

(sacrifice), accat-mdc (billowy), tranat (sandal), εἴδωλοψ ¹ ,

(image), ἁμαρτ-ωλή (sin), eto. Similarly Latin has r, suffix -ela,
forming feminine nouns, loqu-elo (speech), quer-ela (also qaor-
ello, complaint); but the secondary suffix -lo was almost
entirely confined in Latin to a diminutive function, eg. par-vo·

¹ Unless we accept the hypothesis that teyuadca:vacando-effluan-
mc¹clo-e=hey·6·nero-r, cupra 137.
