languages more cr less closely related to one another consiste
in a knowledge of the reason of rulcs and the reason of ex·
ceptions, which latter, when properly understood, will be seen
to really fall under the rule;l and from the mere fact that
grammar thus understood requires less exerticn of the memory
and more of the reasoning powers, it can at the same time be
more easily retained and more surely investigated.

This is the aim of what is called Historical or Compara-
tive Grammar.

(2) Relationship between several languages may be due
either to the fact that one is descended from the other (eg.
French from Latin), or to the fact that they are all descended
from a common ancestor (eg, French, Italian, Spanish, and
Ronmanian, all descended from Latin).2 In the latter case, the
ancestor may be known, and may have left a more or less exten·
sive literature, or at any rate some written documenta, throwing
light on the chief features of its grammar3 or, on the other
hand, it may have perished, without leaving any trace of its
existence except the languages derived from it, which it is

proposed to study. It is in the latter sense that we must
understand the affinity of Greek and Latin, which are not
descended from one another, nor indeed from any language
historically known,3 but are, in common with other European
and Asiatio tongues, derived frome language long since dead,
which never had any written characters, and was spoken

¹ Aperfect grammar would be one which contained not a singleexcep-
tion. The science ol language has not yet reached this stage3 but it is
drawing nearer and nearer to the desired end, though this end can never be
attained.

²Strictly speaking, these expressions horrowed from every-day lile are
inexact. No language is descended from another3 French is not descended
from Latin, for it is impossible to fix any precise moment in history in which
men ceased to speak Latin and began to speak French. As a matteras fact,
French is still Latin, though modified from age to age by changes of which
successive generations had no consciousness. The gap only becomes
apparent when we contrast two pericds separated from one another by a
lolglibirecrdiie must avoid the erroneous expression still too olten used by
learners‚ “This Latin form comes from Greek‚” or ‘⁶ This Greek form comes
from Sanskrit.” Sanskrit is not the ancestor of the other languages; it is
at most their elder brother, and has been subject to quite as many alterations
as its brothers, if not more.
