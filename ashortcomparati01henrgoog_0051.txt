aa (nasal vowel), and indeed very frequently in 011 languages.

Phonetics, thus understood, must evidently form the founda-
tion of all comparative grammar. For what right should we
have to identify any two forms whatsoever, even forms approach-
ing so closely to one another as φέρω and fere, except on the
groundlof having proved by a sufficient number 01 prohable'
instances, that they correspond, sound for soumi, to one another3
in other words, that the Greek φ, ε, ρ, and ω, and the Latin
fit, r, and o, are respectively the representatives and actual
successore 01 the bh, ἒ, r, and o 01 the IndoEuropean word
*blatra which has been restored in accordance with the con-
verging testimony of the different languages 01 the family?
In this respect a scientific system of phonetics will arrive 01
conclusione that must seem startling to the uninitiated. In
etymology, it will separate two words apparently identical; aq.
German scater and French fert, of which the first corresponds
10 Greek πῦρ, and the second to Latin focrtm:¹ while, on the
other hand, it will identify two words which otherwise no one
would ever dreaming 01 connecting3 ep. French tornae and
English tear, which only differ in respect of an additional
suffix in manche The semeis the case in morphology. What
forms could be more alike than πατρί and putre? And yet these
two forms are quite distinct, 00 10 sufficiently proved in the
eyes 01 the phonetician by the difference 01 quantity in thei,
which in Greek is short and in Latin long. On the other hand,
νύκτα and noctem are one and the same word, for in the Greek
‘a there 10 latent the same nasal which is pronounced in Latin.
In this more than in any other branch 01 knowledge we must
be distrustful 01 appearancea
