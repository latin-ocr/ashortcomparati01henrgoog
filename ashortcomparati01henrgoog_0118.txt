FURTHER OOMBINATIONS OF VOWELS AND consortione.

(71) Among the phenomena of phonetic combination or re-
ductim, hitherto mentioned only incidentally, but which deserve-
asomewhat fuller investigation, may be included contractiori,
elision‚ shortening and lengthening, aspiration and de-
aspiration‚ epenthesis, and syncope,

Sueuos 1
consummor.

It is prcbcble, if not certain, that the Indo-European lan·

guage did not tolerate hiatus,1 and that all the forms boqueathed
by it to its descendants were contracted; hence contractiori can
only have taken place in Greek and Latin in those cases cf
hiatus which arose subsequently, especially through the regular
loss of an intervocalic consonant. The lawe regulating this >
preesse are very varied.

§ 1. Greek.

(72) Two vowels in hiatus, whether in the same word (φιλέω),
or in two different words closely connected in meaning and
pronunciation (τὰ ἄλλα), are liable to be contracted into ene
long vowel er diphthong; but in this respect there is con-
siderable divergence between the different dialects. The two
antipodes are Ionic and Attio, which are so close to one another
in other respects; in the former dialect contractionis almost

¹ Except in the case cfc' and u, where there is no real hiatus; for after
a‘or u, followed by a vowel, the corresponding semi-vowel was developed.
and so the pronunciation would be, not ‘t-gtt- (going, Lat. iens), *duo (two),

but approximately *illst-⁹ 'douo ete.
