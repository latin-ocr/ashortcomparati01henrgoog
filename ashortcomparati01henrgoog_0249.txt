ing Latin word feren-s has en a, we know that this very fact
shows that it is not original.¹ Hence we are forced to con-
clude that, if these nominativos ever were sigmatic, their final
s had already disappeared in the Indo-European period, and
this is sufficient -to justify the distinction we have made. On

’ further examining this distinction, we find that a few nomina-

tives (very rare) combine the sign -s with the length‘ening²
end, lastly, that none of these signs occurs in the nominative
of neuter norme, to which a special place must be assigned.

ἕ 1. Sigmatic Nomiaotioe.

(200) We'may classify as follows the stems in which the
- parent-speech admitted final a, which is reproduoed with more
or less fidelity iu Greek and Latin.

1. Vocalic stema: Gk. adh-e, ἴδρι-ς, στάσι-ς; πολύ-ς, vird-s
νέκυ-ς, δρῦ-ς, oid-s (Lacon.) 3² Lat. avi-c, acri-c (whence dcccl),
oteramo-se suevi-s ; manas, froctae, sat-a, gro-s, etc.

2. Diphthooyol stcms: zetadnyvts, Lat. dic-s‚⁵ βοῦ-ς Dor.
diro, Lat. hos, ναῦ-ς, {affirmo-23 with the exception

however of derivatives in -ow- and orl-,⁶ although Greek, the
only language which retains them, has introduced the sigmatic
nominative into some stems of the former close, ag. douo:
*ἥρων-ς, cf. gen. ἥρω-οςε*ἦρωΡ-ος.

3. Guttural or lahial stema: ck. ἅρπαξ;*ἅρπαγ-ς, θώρᾰξ,
θρίξε*θρίχ·ς; φλέψε*φλέβ-ς, εὔωψ, eto.; Lat. audam feroc,
felir ; pleds, Aethiop-s. ,

4. Stoma ending io a petre dentot: the dental is assimilated
to the a, and then the group ss is reduced to a single a, rato:
*adlos= *πόέιδ-ς, milds = *mildss ⁷= *milit-8. Similarly λαμπάς,

Ἴ 7 We must restore these forms, not *πάῑς, *coclea wherever the last vowels
have to be scanned as long, ao. Il. xxii. 4993 foris these vowels had been
long by nature, they would certainly have remained so, of. ὄρνῖς, paries.
ὄρνῖς however is read in 11. xxiv. 2193 here the shortening must be due to
tho analogy of πόλῖς, tholo.
