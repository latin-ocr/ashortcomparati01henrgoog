active, which included both weak and strong forms. This may
be easily verified :the Greek perfect, especially in the oldest

forms, very often shows the weakeued root: to τείνω, for ex-
ample (ι-*τέτ-ρω), corresponds Hom. τέταραιεΰτέτρ-μαι (f.
ruvds=tentue); to θείνω (to striks), Hom. πέφαται (he has
been killed)¹: lo τρέποι, τέτροφα, Hom. re'rpupyuut:*re'·vp¹rr-pat;
to στέλλω, {ecchardi-ordgar, to πεύθομαι, πέπυσμαι, etc.
When the vocalism of the perfect middle was corrupted, it was
modelled on that of the present, never on that of the perfect
active: thus *hfthpat became λέλειμμαι on the analogy of λείπω,
not *λέλοιμμαι on the analogy of λέλοιτα; except, of course,
when both vocalisms agreed, λήθω λέληθα λέλησραι .The perfect
τέταγμαι (Ι have brought forth) on the analogy of τέτοκα, belongs
only to very late Greek.

Latin, with the exception of its socelled perfect active, has
no similar formation; it supplies its place in the middle and
passive by a periphrastic tense, secutus sum, lectus suut. cf.
λελεγμένοι εἶσί.

§2 Saebjuuctiue.

(293) Ι. Actiaca-The perfect not being a thematic tense, the
subjunctive with short vowel would be the only regular formation,
and we do find two examples of it in Homer, εἴδομεν, πεποίθομεν.
But, here as everywhere, the long vowel was introduced, and so
011 λείπωμεν, λύωμεν were based the forms λελοίπωμεν, heliseum.

Greek has only one example of the type, so common in Latin,
formed by addition of the thematis vowel to a secondary stem
with suffix *ll-es< eldc'o:*feub-e'o-u (I may know)=Lat. order-or
It has imposed on it, as on the other forms, the long vowel,
εἰδῶ ethys εἰδῶμεν, whereas Latin regularly has the short vowel, ¹
ordercs=*ceiu-es-es. fn Latin this subjunctive has the function
of a future-perfect3 in its function ef subjunctive it is super·
seded by the optative viderim. ·

Π. Middle.-A form with short vowel, προσαρήρεται, in
Hesiod3 a few forms with long vowel, Att. xexrdpar=lon
