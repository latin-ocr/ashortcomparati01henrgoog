hove had an important share in causing the partial transition
of this'passive form to the thematic flexion.

ξ 3. optative.

(288) Ι. Aeliae—The gradationis faithfully kept through-
out, βαίην βαῖμεν, σταίην σταῖμεν, θείην θεῖμεν, δοίην δοῖμεν, etc.
But each regular form has a corresponding analogical by-form,
βαίημεν, σταίημεν, θείημεν, δοίημεν,1 less used ln good Attio 3 and
wo already lind σταίησαν in Homer (Il. xvii. 733). The analogy
of the subjunctive with long vowel gave rise to an optative
’λ’θέοιμι,2 of which various forms are found in Herodotus and
Attio writers, and in particular *θοίτε in κατάθοιτε (the accont
thrown back owing to the contraction being forgotten).

2. Itis clear that the optative of the sigmatic aorist ought
strictly to be *λιψ-ίησ *liud-per. No such form is found; but
we may be permittod to restore one which is very much like
it, namely *λειψ-είη-ν, *loo-etro. The precise origin of this
interpolatori ε is not very easy to determin03 but it may at
any rate be obsorvcd that it has an exact correlative in the
perfect optative εἰδ-είη-ν,3 and better still in the Latin sigmatio
aorist optative naracustoma-iola. Howover ’ this may
be, the regular inflexion gave a ard pl. λείψειανε*λειψει-ᾐί, and
on this form λείψειαν, as on that oi the indicative ἔλειψαν,ι was
based by analogy a new mode of inflexion, wrongly called
AEollc‚ λείψεια, λείψειας, λείψειε, etc. In good Attio it is com·
bined with the following mode of inflexion, thus forming the
·paradigm λύσαιμι, λύσειας (and λύσαις), λύσειε (and λύσαι),
λύσαιμεν, λύσαιτε, λύσειαν (and λύσαιεν), λύσαιτον, λύσαίτην.

The inflexion λύσαιμι λίσαιμεν needs no comment3 it is the
optative based on the false stem λῦσα.

3. In the thematio aorist, λάβοιμι λάβοιμεν.

Π. Middlo-Always the weak form, with no irregularities,
θείμην, δοίμην. Falso thomatio vowel introduced in New Ion
προσθέοιτο, Aa. προσθοῖτο and πρόσθοιτο.

2. λῦσαίμην, λειψαίμην, like λύσαιμι.

3. Ιιι the thematic aorist, λαβοίμην, λιποίμην.
