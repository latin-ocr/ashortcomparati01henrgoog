5. When the syllabic augment is prefixed to a verb beginning
with a consonant which, when occurring between two vowels,
is lost, it is usually eontracted with the vowel thus placed next
'to it: εἰργάζετο (λθ was working=*c'·Fspder-ro), eiy0v=*t-feyo-v
or *ἔπεχε-ν, εἶπόμηνέ*ε’-σεπό·μην (cf. Lat. sequor),l etc. More-
over in certain cases, in which contractiori did not take place,
the syllabic augment may still easily be recognised: Hom. ἔειπε
(class. εἶπε), ε’άνασσε (λθ ruled), class. ε’άγη, ἑάλων (cf. inf.
ἁλῶναι), ε’ωνούρην (Ι was buying)=*e’·focwerl·yaryv, Lat. turtum
:uesano-m, etc.

6. By a wrong extension of the d‘iphthong ει thus resulting from
contractiori, and especially through the analogy of the reduplica-
tion in ει of εἴληφε,2 were created the rare forms, παρελήφθησαν,
διειλέχθη.

(234) II. The ternporal augment is much less uniform in
character than the syllabic augment, and requires the following
observatione.

1. An initial long vowel naturally cannot be affected by the
augment: ἠρερέω (to be quiet), ἡρέμησα. Hence probably arose
the analogy which led to its suppression even in verbs beginning
with a short vowel. ’ .

2. Initial d, ε’, ὀ, when augmented, become respectively ᾶ (Ion.-
Att. ἠ), ἠ, o'r: dyo), Dor. ἆγε-ν, Ion-Au. ἦγο-ν; ἦα (Ι was) =*r’yo-a=
*ds-tp, root ε’σ; ὧρ-το from ὅρνῦ-μι, eto.

3. Through analogy, initial ἴ and ὔ may become land ῦ (Hom.
ῑαχον, they cried, Il. ii. 394), butas a rule they romain un·
changed.

4. The initial diphthongs at, οἰ and αὖ in ordinary Greek be·
come ῄ, ᾠελᾱ ηὐ; εἰ and εὖ romain unchanged in common Greek,
but are augmented in good Attio, εἰκάζω (to conjecture) ᾔκαζον,
εὑρίσκω εὖρέθη; lastly, initia] oviis never changed.

¹ Thus the difference between εἷρπε (ol. ἕρπειν) and ἦλθε (cl. ἐλθεῖν) is con-
nected with the lact that the former, quite regularly, has the syllabis, tha
latter the temporat augment. In Dorio, where εε is contracted to η, we
have regularly ἦχον, etc. The Lesbian form εὔιδεν (stt. εἴδοντ’ἔ-Ὲιδεν) still

shows the f of the root fad.
