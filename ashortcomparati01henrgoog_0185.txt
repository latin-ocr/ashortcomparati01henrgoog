afterwards quite apart from them, of the verbs in -άζω and -ίζω,
so that theee two terminatione spread in all directions, until
the Greek lexicon was filled with them: ὀνομάζω (ιο name),
ιἐάζω (ιο be young), τεράζω (ιο work miracles), βσιιιλίζω (to
reign), ὀνειδίζω (ιο ιιιοι reproaches), λογίζομαι (ιο reason), etc.l
These verbs in their turn have nominal derivativas in -ao-pds,
-ασ-μα, -ασ-τής, -ασ-τι-κᾶς, -ισ-μός, -ισ-μα, eta, which are still
created by borrowing and analogy ιιι our own day, e..g art- ist,

the suffix -σκο- toa thematic form, especially in the present or
aorist, produces the forms called iteratives, φειγ-ε-σκε (he fied),

κολέ-ε-σκε (he called), φύγ-ε-σκε (fied), ἶδ-ε-σκε (he saw), which ι

are extremely common in Ηοιιιοι2 and Herodotus. These forms
show the curicus peculiarities of never being used in the pre
