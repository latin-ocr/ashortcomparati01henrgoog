from ζυγά-νς1 τῐ-μά-ω (10 honour) from τι-μή, sorraco=*for·-mu·y0,
supe: *sup-dyo, ορθνονε’10001-11-(1011 from opera (fem, work),
etc. When once the verbal endings -εό, de, -αῠ had been thus
developed, it was inevitable that they should be confused in the
process of derivation. This is very common: thus, in Greek,
φωνή givos φωνέω instead of (101103 ἱερός on the contrary gives
ἶεράω, and γέφῦρα (bridge) γεφῦρόω; in Latin we have laeteri
from 1001110, foedare from foedus, capture from captus, and this ’
termination tare, being extended, forms the numerous class 01
verbs called frequentatives, ten-ture (01. teu-erc), factore (01.
sac-ere), versare (cf. versus and uertere), etc.

Bya new extensior, these terminatione are added entire to
primary stems not ending in e or a, and so without any inter·
mediate stage ἀφρονέω is formed from ἄφρων, πυρόω from πῦρ,
arcere from arc-s, necare from nec-s, equitare from equ-i-t,
eto.³ This termination -c’to in its turn has also been introduced
elsewhere, and produces ool-ito, frequentative 01 uolo, and
then, combined with the type in -10 which we have just seen,
the not uncommon frequentative termination -tito, as in lec-tito,
sac-tite, etc.

The result 01011 this is, that very often, especially in Latin,
the base 01 derivation in these verbs is entirely wanting, either
ἲ because it has been lost through disuse, or because it never had
any existence at all, the verb having been created by a mere
analogioalassociation. Thus we can find no substantive form-
ing the base 01 the verbs amare, mouere, cocere, and many
others: and the same remark may also be made in regard 10
011 the classes 01 secondary derivation.

Before the suffix ·yo- the ending of the primary stem seems
10 be always short, at any rate in Greek, but this regularity
is not original, and forms like Hom. ἀδικήομεν (we injure) from

¹As a general rule the verbs in ·e'u have an active, those in -όω 0
causative sense, ap. πολεμέω (10 make war), πολεμόω (to cause war). Latin
has no verbs inco, except perhaps *capr-oo (10 make sich), 01 which

⁸ In Latin especially this process has been carried 10 very grem lengths,
and the Romanoa languages have followed in the same trech, with a marked
preference tor verbs 01 the lst coniugation. No one in French would dream
01 creating a verb ‘salicplir or *telephorwia
