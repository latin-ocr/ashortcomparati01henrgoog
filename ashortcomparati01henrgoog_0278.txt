2. Accusativc: on, Gk. ν, Lat. aaa: τό-ν, istc-m, etc.

3. Ablative (l): Gk. οὕτω obambire& Lat. i8t6=*isl(ld,
istc=*istud‚ qna (how)=*qntd‚ etc.1

4. Abluticc (2): Gk. πό-θεν, αὐτό-θεν,2 ete.; Lat. art-cle (the
nasalization is imitated from inde, supra 187, 6), so also *cende
:maenae in alicunde, ci. cc-bt, *cu-bi.

5. Instrumentul (1): Gk. πῆ, αὐτῆ, ἁλλῆ, etc.; Lat. qud, hcl-c
(this way), istd-c, illd-c.8 ’

6. bustrumcntal (2): Gr. αὖτό-φι ;4 Lat. (locative sense) ibo,
*calceamina in clienta, ubi, from a stem cu, found also in
the comparative uter, ali-bt with final lengthening perhaps on
the analogy of the dative, ef. tica

7. Locatlvc· Dor. τεῖ-δε, ete, Gk. (illative sense) ποῖ, ete,
Lesb. ἅλλυι, πήλυι (far off, of. τῆλε);5 Lat. hi-c=hci-c=(here)‚
istc-c, illi-c. The illative bn-c=*hoi-c‚ istnc, illuc, cair (why)=
*quoi-r (the r is a particle of the same kind as the Gk. ῥα ἄρα),
corresponds phonetically to the accented (not enclitic) ποῖ.

8. Dalion-Greek has the ordinary dative endings in the
-o and deleme: τῷ, τᾷ τῇ. But in Latin the termination -ῑ
of the dat-ive, instead of being added to the final o· or u· of
the stem, appears to eliminate and supersede it; instead of a
dative *illa *illua which would seem to be required by the
acc. illu-m, illu-m and the corresponding Greek forms, we have
ill-t for all three genders, as in the imparisyllabic deelension.
It is probabis that this ending, at first belonging exclusively
to demonstratives of the imparisyllabic deelension (qui-s, i-s),
was extended to the others by analogy. This much is certain,
that, having spread side by side with the genitive termination
-tus (infra), it was added to stoms which were nomina] in their
origin and resembled pronouns only in meaning: thus clau-s
(=Gk. οἶνό-ς) has dat. aza-t, sollu-s (εὸλος) colle, aller (com-
parative in -τερο-) alter-t, though the nom-acc. neut. clau-m (not
*cina-d), eto, would suffice to prove that their original deelen-
sion was nominal.
