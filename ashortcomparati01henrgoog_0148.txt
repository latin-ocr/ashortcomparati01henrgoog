semler numvarrou. 109

character of the root is uncertain, eq. pol-riv (to go), dau-riv
(to die), βαλ-εἲν no doubt on the analogy of βάλλω.ι More rarely
still the normal grado crept in, ey. rex-eir (to bring forth)
where however the form without ε would be unpronounceable,
γεψέισθαι (of. γέν-ος), rep-riv (to cut, cf. pres. τέμ-νω). Latin ’
shows only a few traces of this form, which is so common in
Greek, namely, in old Latin, the aorists tayo, toy-it (con-
trasted with the nasalized present teopo), popo-ut or pac-out
(they have made an agreement?¹ cf. the presente pereyo and
poc-isco-r), and evenin classical Latin the participle por-emes
(those who have brought forth), contrasted with the present
participle par-iebt-es (those who bring forth).

IX. Stenas with suffic -e-ld· preceded by reduplicatioo with
the vowel e: in Greek reduplicated second amiate-This class,
except lor the additional reduplication, is absolutely identioal
with the preceding one, though much rarer: tlt-hadar (I hid
myselffl3 Hom. λε-λαβ-ἐ-σθαι (Od. iv. 388), πεπιθόντες (Il. xxiii. 37),
class. ἧγ-ᾱγ-όν aorist of ‹ty-o with so called Attio reduplication;
class. riuor=Hom. tetradi-ferma with augment, reduplica-
tion, end weakened form of the root ferr (to speak, cf. fer-os),
like ἔ-πε-φν-ο-ν with weakening of the root phere (to kill, ci.
deirwaud φον-ό-ς ³); similarly imper. εῑπ-ἔεὶειπέ (say)=*fr-fr·e'.⁴

Latin no longer has anything similar3 if inquit is a syncope
for *io-oequit (he says, root oeqo=ferr, cf. odo-s and Gk. fter-s,
voice)⁵ we see that the root has not there been accompanied
by any reduplication.

X. Stoma arith suffire -e·l·0· (proethnic accent unknown) pre-
ceded oy reduplicatioo wito the vowel i: Greek and Latin
presente-The rootis weakened. Greek: yi-yo-opai, cf. γέν-ος;

¹ We should expect 'ph-eir, of. the normal grade in §th-or and the deflected
grade in βολ·ή; but the so-called roots with metathesis, like βόλ-λω phe-rte,
θαν-εΐν Ort-exe show gradatione still partially unexplained‚ which are no
doubt connected with the presence ot long sonant nasale and liquide, of.
supra 49 and 52 infiat.

² Lep. xii. Tot. “rem ubet parcnt orotod ” (when the parties have come to
an¹³ agreement resppcting the suit, let the judge ratify their agreement).

⁴ The dibhthong ει in etro cannot be explained by *ἔπω preceded by the
augment, for then it would not remain iu all moods cl the aorist.

⁵ In any case, the let pers. taquam cau only bea subjunctive.
