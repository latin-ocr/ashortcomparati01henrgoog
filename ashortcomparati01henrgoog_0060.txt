ELEMENTS OF PHYSIOLOGIGAL PHONETICS. ‘21

3. Diphthongs. Diphthongs are often defined as the meet·
ing of two vowels in one syllable, but this definition is faulty,
for two real vowels must necessarily form two syllables, sepa·
rated from one another by the smooth breathing, which, as we
have seen, precedes the utterance of every vowel. This is
the case with the two vowels of the English word poet. If the *
solt, breathing is absent, as in the English interjection oye,
the second sound is not and cannot ba avowel; it is onlya
consonant of a particular kind, which rests upon the preceding

vowel, end, in order to recall its vocalic origin, is often called
a semi-vowel.

Every vowel may become a semivowel, with the single ex-
ception of a, the utterance of which is inseparable from the
smooth breathing. But it is especially the two extremes of
the vocalia scale, i and aa, which are liable to this change; their
semi-vowels will be represented by y and rw. The semi-vowel

of o can easily be perceived in the French words lui, pluis. ·

The semi-vovete of e and o approximate respectively to those
of c' and eal

It will be seen then that we must caresully distinguish real ’
diphthongS‚ which are composed of a vowel and a semi·
vowel, oy, or of a semi-vowel and a vowel, yo, joined
together in one syllable, and salse diphthongs, which only appear
such in consequence of the way in which they are written, and
which in reality are simple vowels. In French the groups
aaa and ora are diphthongs only to the eye; they represent ,the
vowels d(close) and aa So also rn Greek we shall see that
αυ was a diphthong, vbut ου a vowel.

4. Long and Short Vowels Every vowel, whether oral,
nasalized, or in a diphthong, may either be uttered very quickly
or prolonged during the whole of a single expiration3 hence
an indefinite number of degrees os quantity, which may easily
be observed in language, whether spoken or sung. For the

sake of simplicity, grammarians have reduced these varieties
to two, long and short, α’, ἆ, and have also agreed to regard the
duration of along vowel as about twice that ol a short one.

¹ Thus the word acca [becket] (a dissyllable with close e), which has become
in French the monosyllable eo (close o), is pronounced ayo in certain dialects.
