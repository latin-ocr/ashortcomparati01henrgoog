δείκ·νυ-σθαι, diva-odor, bri-rodae λύ-σε·σθαι, λύ·σα-σθαι, λυ-θήήσε·

(168) IV. Suffloo wil-2 forms secondarily a very large number
of noune denoting agent, κεραμ-εύς (potter) from nipap-cs (clay),
ypappar-rrir (scribe) from γράμ-μα (letter), ἀγωγεύς (leader)
from ἀγωγή, anda few noune denoting instrument, ιιῖγ-ωγ-εώςΔ

(169) V. Saffioe ·τᾰ·; very important. (1)Nounsdenoting
agent, derived from verbe, and generally oxytone: with short
themello vowel, ripe-rte (inventor), ναι-ἐ-τψς (inhabitant); with
sigmatic insertion, ipa-‹r-rr'ys (lover) ; with long thenolio vowel,
troi-p-rv're νῐκ-ηηῆῆ with signatio insertion, opp-po-n'rs (dancer).
(2) Nouns derived from noune, generally paroxytone: οἶκ·έ-τη-ς
(servant), δημ-ό-τψς (citizen), rpopews (look-out man). In most
cases the vowel of the primary stem undergoes before the suffix
-ττΓ a lengthening of doubtful origin:l deo-perpe (prisoner)
from dec-pds (feti-er), eol-erm from πολ-ἶ-ς, πρεσβῡ-τνγς (old
man) from πρέσβ-ῗνς, etc. From these and similar formatione
heve been formed the common suffixae -ῖτψ -e'nr, -ήτη-, -ώτψ,
-ιώτγγε ὁδίτης (traveller), dub-irae (hoplite), leprirvrs (prieet)
γυμν-ήτψς (light-armed soldier), στρατι-ώτψς (soldier) from
στρατιά, cruor-ciros (partisan) from στά-σι-ς, vno-ideas (islander)

are derived from these noune, στρατιωτικός (military).

talkativc), ῑδι-αί-τατινς (entirely one’s own), eto.

(170) VIII. Suffioc dd: very rare as a secondary suffix,
