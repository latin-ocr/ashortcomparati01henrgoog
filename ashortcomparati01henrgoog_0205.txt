as a secondery suffix. Its chief function seems to be to form
femininos of adjectives or noune,l which have mostly become
independent feminine substantivas: thus πέτρᾶ Δελφίς (soph),
Ἴ “ the Delphian rock'': {pppis (dos, tame), fem. of ἥμερος
(tame), and, with ellipse of δρῦς, “cah with esculent acorns'’;
oa-rpib- “poternal,” and, with ellipse of γῆ, “native land'’;
then by analogy ἡγεμονίς (sovereign)‚ βασιλίς (queen), etc.

X. Srtffiec -ισσαι this somewhat rere suffix is apparently con-
nected with the preceding one and likewise forms feminine
nouns, daath-icoomueen). It was borrowed by Latin, pro-
phetissa, and thence passed into the Romanae languages, and
we know how common it has become in Ehench under the form
-ecse [Eng. css, eg prophet-ess}

XI. Suffioees -ίσκο-, -ίσκη, and -ίσκ·ιο- : form a few diminutiveS,
vedu-foros (young man) from νεᾶν-ίῡπς, παιδ-ίσκη (little girl),
ἇσπιδ-ίσκιψν (small shield).

XII. Suffioe -crivo'iz forms abstract nouns derived from adjec-
tives, δικα-ιινσύνη (justice), puppo-odra (memory), from μνήμων,
whence the suffix -οσύνη in rexwoodvp (art), μαντ-οσύνη (art of
divination)‚ κλεπτ-οσύνη (thievishness).2 ,

(171) Ι. Sufflcc -ndo-.—The gerundives and future parti-
ciples passive are formed by the addition of this suffix to the
verbal stem, the final vowel of which assumes indifferently the
form o or e: dicundum, leuc repet-condacum (pecuniarum,
law against extortion), and otc-eadum, amandus, monendus,
etc. The form in u however was regarded as archaic and the
form ine prevailed‚ except in eundum and the adj. secundus
(following) from the verb sequor (demetendos). Is it to
the supposed existence in this last type of a suffix cundu- that
we must ascribe the origin of stt-cundati, iracunda-3, etc?
This point is obscure. The suffix -bonda seems clearer3 we

¹ Probably through a faint reminiscence oi the feminine iunction oi the
suffix -i·‚ which also recurs in Latin expended by aguttural instead of a
dentol in forms like vic-trica.
