compare moenia (walls) with munire, poena with punire, and
we may notice that foedus (treaty)=*foidoa has the same
relation to feiclo (to trust) that pondua has to pendul We
may be surprised that oe should thus have survived excep-
tionally in these words and possiblya few others; but poena
is borrowed from the Greek; the archaiem moenia, which
was certainly read in the Annals of the Pontiffs‚ may have ,
been restored to favour in order to avoid confusion with the¹
regular mania, which had taken the sense of “public dutics,''
and from the same Annals the Roman historiens must have
borrowed the archaism foedus.2 Unaccented oy became t:
final -oy in locutive singular of second declension‚ Gk. ἵπποι, Lat.
epum and so also in the dative plural, Gk. ἵπποις, Lat. equis.

recognise in Latin, lor r'r may come either from eu or οιι; and ' ξ

hence, when we see a perfect like sup-i (cf. archaic mi, fili),
we cannot tell whether it goes back to the regular *sorry-b

duced. The former alternative however seems the more likely. j
