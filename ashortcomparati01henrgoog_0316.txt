If we transfer to Latin the regular paradigm which has Just
been studied in the case of Greek, we shall obtain, incitatis
mutandis, the following forms: sing. 1 *uida 2 *ests-tal 3
*uid-c ; plur. 1 *cidaras 2 *vita-tis,3 *vid-ean and, on oon-

trasting these with the real forms, we can see the general
features that characteriue the substitution of the latter for the
former. Just as Greek has generalised a stem λέλοιπα-, so
Latin has based its flexion ona false stem vidi, liqui. Nothing
can be more simple; bnt difficulties abeund as scon as we wish
to gc into details. Howevm, let us make the attempt, so far
as it is possible.

Singultus—lm person: uid-i, loqu-i. The Greek terminaticn
-a is active, the Latin ending -1 is middle and corresponds to Lu
*up Sk. -e (cf. Sk. bubhdvu, I was, mid. bubhuud=Lat fat-t
fut). This termination was naturally introduced into the sig-
matic aorist which was confused with the perfect: dioc-i, uic-i.

ind. If, instead of the active *uita-te, we assume the corre·
sponding middle form, we shall have *uiis-tt=*oid-ti. It is
true that this form does not exist3 but we find a counterpart
to it in such a form as diac-ti, which it is quite unneoessary to
explain through a syncope of duriam for it represents very ’
exactly a sigmatic aorist stem diu-:Gk (Oiai, to which a
perfect terminaticn has been added. Hence we can see how,
aided by the lst sing. uidi, etc, the primitive forms forasti,
*ieiuna dimi, *uiuit might be superseded by uidisti, cecidisti,
diuisit, coniuncto, and secondarily *uc-u by liquisti, *papio-tt
oy pepigisti, etc. We must add, finally, the probable influence
of the stem *utdc's-, *uquam which appears in the perf. subj.
(viminalem), in the optative (uuir-immudis? etc, and is
certainly not absent from the indicative (cf. iufra 3rd plural
and the formation of the pluperfect, infru 298); and we shall
then be able tc form some idea of the analogical influences
which have crossed one another in this complicated formation.

3rd: udi-t, by addition of the secondary ending ·i to the
ialse stem in ·i·.
Plorat—ist person: uidi-mus, which perhaps goes back
