instances of the substitution ol the augment, which is general
in the Panhellenio ἔγνωκα, if, on the other hand, the second
consonant is an explosive or sibilant, or if the initial consonant
ie ζ, the augment almost everywhere prevails: ἔζευγμαι (cf. the
reduplicated form δίζημαι),3 ἔψευσμαι, ἔκτημαι (in prose however
κέκτημαι), ἔπτυκα (Ι have spi‘t), ἔπτυχα (Ι have folded), ἔπτηχα
(Ι have frightened, but also πέπτηχα and Hom. πεπτηώς),3 ἔσχισται,
(it hasbeen split), ἔστικπαι (it hasbeen priched), ἔσσυται (it has
been thrown) from σεύωε Accede: -lqyawc (sk οηάυᾱ- mi), and
so almost always with σ followed by a consonant.
⁴ 5 When once the' reduplication had been confused with the
augment, it was liable to the corruptions mentioned abowe'3 as
¹being due to the analogioal extensiones the long augment:
thus the pf. ἑόρακα is not uncommon, but mostly we find ἑώρακα
on the model of ἑώρων, so also ἑάλωκα and even ἐώλπει (Il. xix.
328), ἐώργει int the text of Homer, the latter forms being
pluperfect s with an interna] temporal augment, unless they are
merely copyist-s' errore.

6. In the reduplication off, when the two f’s had fallen away, ’

the vowels, being left next to one another, were contracted,

when contraction was possible: cippaouni=llfe=fipyuo=pau εἴρηκα

(I have said)=*fe·fc‘pry-r·u, etc. The diphthong of εἴρηκα was =
reproduced in the three Attio perfecte εἶληηια4 (Herod. λελάβηκα),

εἴλαχα εἶλεγμαι (especially in compounds, but the simple λέλεγμαι

exists in good Greek), εἴληχα (from λαγχάνα, in Homer regularly

λέλογχα), where the radical η is certainly due to the analogy of

εἴληφα.

(239) II. Temperat reduplication occureunderlthe same con-
ditione as the temporal augment and is subject to the same
’ laws:⁵ ἄγω ἦγμαι, αἱρέω ᾗρηκα, ἶκνέομαι ἀφῖχθαι inf.; but εὕρηκα,
αὕτασμαι (Ι am wounded), eto. It has been suggested that this
augment occurs in the Latin forms eya (from ugo), *epi (from
lecepit), ccept= *coepib and that in these cases the e was due to
the Indo-European contractior of eo* (eg. ἰαη, *capg and
was afterwards extended by analogy to fect from facie, cept
