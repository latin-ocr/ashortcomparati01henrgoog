by the addition of the thematic vowel.l Hence if a present
*charoni (I bear) regularly becomes in the subjunctive *blatra
or *thot-c, it is quite natural that a thematic present *dher-o
or *blicr-e· should in its turn become in the subjunctive *baar-o
:witero-o- or *bber-e-=*blrar-c·e·. In short, the subjuwuve
with a long vowel in the thematic tenses exactly corresj onds
to the subjunctive with a short vowel in the non-thematic
forms. Hence the law which simply lengthens in the sub·
junctive the short vowel of the indicative, pipo-pov piper-pov,
φέρ-εῆε φέρ-η-τε, &hin-oper tte-apen, ε’·λίπ-ε-τε hin-tyre, and so
everywhere.

If we pass to Latin, it seems difficult to overlook the close
connexion between λέγ-η-τε and leq-etis (future of the tro and
tth conjugatione). On the other hand, icy-ec and lep-et:
*lep-at with long vowel exactly correspond to the short forms
of the present indicative, *leq-ec, *lep-at, which have become
lep-ic, lep-it. 'Phe lst and 3rd pers. pl. leq-cenos (for rimemus)
and lep-cot (for *lep-ont) must have taken the vowel e through
the analogy of the other forms. There remains the lst sing.
legum, which was borrowed from the subjunctive in -ᾱ-.2 The
connexion of meaning is no difficulty; the subjunctive, de-
noting essentially a prayer or an eventuelity, is well suited to
express the future meaning, and there are examples of a similar
process in various lenguages

Thus the future of the ard and 4th conjugation is identical
with the secondary subjunctive of Greek.3 Perhaps the same
should be said of the subjunctive of the lst conjugation, carew
thus ametis would go back to *amu-atie, cf τῖμά-η-τε, urraca,
umet to *uma-ec, *amoc-t, the ἑ having then contaminated
the other three persons. This is extremely probable.

³ This explanation is lar from being universally admitted3 some, dis-
daining phonetic lawe, would see an optative in ἱερέεελέγοιπ 'others connect
cap-ico with codar, not seeing that the t of captae comes from the present
capio. We cannot stop to discuss this point.
