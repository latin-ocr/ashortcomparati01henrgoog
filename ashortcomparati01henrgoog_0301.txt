2. It Greek, an aspirata is changed in reduplication to the
corresp ending non-aspirated consonant: πεφίλημαιε*φε-φίλρραι, .

cf. sk. babber-a (he bore)=I.-E. *haector-est so 616οτέ-θεικ-α,

“ κε’·χανδ-α, etc.

3. When a group of consonante occurs at the beginning of a
word, the whole group is never reduplicated; but its treatment
differs in sancierit, Greek and Latin, which seems to show that
each of these languages has corrupted after its own lashion the
primitive reduplication ol the whole group. In Greek the first
consonant alone is reduplicated: βέ-βλρκ-α, κε’-κπρμαι, impr-a
=*cc‘·ord-x·o, ἔρρανγα (Ι have broken)=*fc'-fpwy·a, ator ‘In ·
Sanskrit it is often the second: ta-ctb-rtr (they stood), root
etha. In Latin both are reduplicated, but the first disappears
from the radical syllable: steti for *ate-sti (through analogy of
cle-cl-t), spopondi (I promised) lor *spe-sponda, from spondeo.

4.1nirial σ in reduplication naturally becomes the rough
breathing: ἕστηκα; εἵμαρται (it has been given as a share)=
*σέ-σμαρ-ται, 1661 (reduced) *emer (to share, cf. μέρος and μοῖρα
;*σμόργ-α),3 etc. Now it might hoppen that this rough
breathing was changed to the soft breathing, either dialectically,
through simple psilosis‚ ap. Hom. AEol. ἔμμορε (he shared)=
*ci-epops, or generally, through the proximity ol another
aspirato, ap. ἔσχηκαε*ἔσχηκαε*σέ-σχη-κ-α.4 Again, in re·
duplication initial fwas lost in Ionio-Attic‚⁵ whence ἔοικα (Ι
resemble)=*f‹‘-forx·a, ἔολπα (Ῑ hope)=*fe'-fohrr-n‚ ἔοργα (Ι have
worked)=*fe'·fopy·o‚ ἔρρωγα, ἔρρῐφα, ε’ρρύηκα, etc. Hence in 'the
last two cases the reduplication did not differ from the syllabic
augment; this led to the substitution of the syllabic augment
instead of partia] reduplication in an initial group of con-
sonante. The general rule in regard to the use of the two
prefixesis as follows: when the second consonant is e liquid
*or nasal² partial reduplication takes place² γέγραφα, βέβλαφα,
τέτρῖμμαι, μέμνημαι, though dialectica] inscriptions show many
