THE vocnt APPARATUS ΔΤ RES'P.

(18) Like every wind-instrument, the vocal apparatus may
be said to consist of a pair ol bellom, omitting a current of
air; a sonorous tube, into which the current of air, moro or
less impeded in its way, enters in vibrations; and of a sound-
ing-board, by contact with which tho volume of tho sound is
increased.

The bellows are the lunge. As they can only supply air
during the process of expiration, the momente of inspiration
arc intervals of rest, such as aro denoted by punctuation.
There are not, at any rate in the languages with which we are
concerned, any inspiratory eounda

The air expired, escaping through the bronchi and tho wind-
pipe, reaches the larynx, which isat the uppor end of the
windpipe. The grietly protuberanco of the larynx can he
easily felt on the throat, and by watching its motion during cho,
. ’ process of speaking a very rough idea may be formed of
the mechanism of speech. The larynx in its turn opens into
the pharynx by a round apertura called tho glottis, tho ¹uppcr
margins of which, called vocal chords, are hard and clastic, and,
by contracting‚ are able to oppose an obstacle to the current of
air, and to vibrate while it- is passing through.

The sounding·board consists of the double cawity of the mouth
and nostrils. The shape and siae of this cavity may vary,
in such a way as to modify the sound omitted through the
glottis, under the influenco of three chief factoro:

1. The clasticity of the inncr and outer walls of the mouth,
