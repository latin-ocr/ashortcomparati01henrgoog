Classical Latin possessed none of the nasalixed vowels which

vowel comes first are six in number: ai, ei, ci-au, eu, cu.
Some oi these survived in classical Latin3 all became more or
less simple vowels in popular Latin.

The archaic spelling aa· (Am1L18,Ep. Scip.) and the classical
spelling ae both represent a true diphthong which contained a
semi-vowel formed hy a mixture of i and e,1 but was early
reduced in the popular speech to a simple e. The same is the
case with oi, classical ce, which however is hardly a Latin
sound at all, except asa contraction of o÷e in coeptum, etc.·;
for the archaic oi (moiaicipiom) regularly became either τι
or 6, and survived only in a few archaisms like moenia,
foedus. The later oe is a mere transcription oi Greek οι in
borrowed words, ροοηαεποινή. The Romanos languages no
