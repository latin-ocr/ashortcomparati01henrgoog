(6) IL-The European bianch is divided into seven main
groups: Armenian, Hellenic, Italic, Celtic, Germanic, Letto
Slavonic, andAlbanian. The first and last have but recently
come within the range of Indo-European comparison, and hold
only a very subordinate position therein. The second and third
require special consideration.

(7) 1. At first sight the Hellenic group seems to include
only one language, Greek, represented in ,the most ancient
times by the Homeric poema of which certain parts at least go
back to the ninth century B.c.; in the period which precedes
and follows the age of Pericles hy the brilliant Ionic, Attio, and
Alexandrian literaturae, in the Middla Ages· by the Byzantina ’
writers, at the present day by modern Greek. But it would
be a great mistake to suppose that all these recorda belong to a
single language, or that they each reflect faithfully the current
speech of the timo and country to which they belong. The
language of the Homeric poems is a purely artificial mixture of
AEolic and Ionic forms3 that of the tragedians certainly differs
greatly from that spoken by the Athenian spectators; the
Byzantinos wrote in Greek in the same way that the Schoolmen
wrote in Latiu; and at the present time Greek newspapers are
written in a language which would be more easily understood by
Pericles himself than by a contemporary who isat all illiterato.

The real form assumed by the language at a particular period
and in a particular part of Greece has fortunatoly been revealed =

from the necessarily limited number of mistakes on the part of
the writers, give us absolutely accurate information ; from them
a rich harvest has already been gathered. By the light ol
these sources of information, supplemented by the hints of the
ancient grammarians, it has become possible to distinguish at
the outset in the Hellenic unity two groupS, which may be
distinguished by this fundamental difference, that one, the
N on-Ionic group, always keeps primitive d, whereas the Ionic
group changes it to ἒ. Thus, Indo-European *sistdmi (I place,
