in Greek and Latin, feminine abstraot nouns derived from
adjectives, sspaborfyr· (nom. βραδυτής, slowness, Dor. βραδοτᾱς),
foc-ili-tot- (nom. facilitas), etc. Thefinal vowel of o·stems
appears under the form of ο in Greek before the suffix tot,
φιλότης, κουφότης, whence the suffix -ότητ- which has spread to
other formatione, now-dms(universality)‚ ἑν-ότης (unity). In
Latin, on the contrary, it assumes the form of e, firmi-tots:
*fir-metat, nonime, vanitas, veritos, whence the suffix -itot- in
cclcc-itus, ropac-itas, eto. But after an ι’ the thematio vowel
e is not changed, pie-tota, varie-tas.

(165) XX. Gaffiot -went-.-It is especially the Sk. -oant-
that shows us the original formos this suffix (in Greek -εντ-),
which helps to form many secondary adjectives meaning “ pro-
vided with '' : χαρίειςε*χαρ-ί-Ρεντ-ς (graccful)‚ πτερά-εις (winged)‚
ἀλκήεις, Dor. ὀλκᾰεις (vigorous). From these last types were
formed the terminatione -όεις, -ήεις, which became very common,
σκιόεις (Shady‚ from σκίᾶ), δακρυόεις (tearful),⁴ δενδρήεις (woody)‚

κῦδήεις (glorious, from κῦδος), eto. This suffix must have been ’ .

originally reduced to -Ἑῃτ- before the feminine suffix -ῑ-, whence
*xapt'fw-ya, *xopt'furya *xopt'fuoou3 then the analogy of the
masculine and neuter forms substituted ε for a, ond so we have
the fem. χαρίεσσα, by the side of the regular form τιθεῖσα derived
from vador-J

It is probably the same suffire, together with a new element
-ο, which is to be recognised in the Latin type cruentus:
*crta-uentos (?); hence would arise the suffix -ento, the addition
of which to diminutives in -olo, eg. oio-olentes (ἀοοιιΙςοιι),2
is perhaps the origin of the not unoommon suffix olente,
violentae, pulver-ntentans, eto.

Another and much more important Latin formation certainly
belongs to this series, Suppose in Greek a word ider: ⁴ ,
*truditur-s (poisonous); the regular Latin correlative would
be *otrouent, and with a tertiary suffire-to, *circueat-to,
whence terraconam, then by syncope or contraction of the

¹ We might however, perhaps more simply, start from the regular com·
parative χαριέστεροι-τ“-Ρένσ-τερσ-, supro 47 G [and 64 Α].

² Perhaps an old euphemkm, “one who has taken alittlo wine” ol
French sooul (surfeited, drunkenl=rotullua (dimin. of satur).
