besides the fact that the aecent of χαμαί violatos the accentual
laws of the lst declension. that *χαμᾱ- does not exist,l and
that the thematic vowel ἄ is rather remarkable, it must be
observed that the corresponding Latin form isRomae, which
presupposes *Bomoi for *Roma-t would have become *Roma
Hence it is probable that χαμαί must belong to another
class of stems‚2 and thatin Greek the locative *χώρᾶᾶ was
entirely confused with the dative. In Latin the two forms
remained distinct; but, by reason of their partial likeness, the
cases were equally confused3 the locative being Boreae and
the dative emtor, the Latius said indifferently for either case
Ronutt or Romoc; moreover, as in the 2nd declension, the
locative assumed the functione of the genitive. Then the loo.-
gen.dat. terrai, Romae, gradually gave way before the loc.-
gen.dat. terrae, Romae3 the former inflexion, which is still
very common in Lucretius, has become by the Augustan'age'
amere poetic archaism.

two mares), seems to be represented with a fair degree oi
accuracy by the two Latin forms duae and ambae. In Greek
the dual of the lst declension is rare and late (it is not found

in Homer ⁶), and is certainly a new formation3 for, if χώρᾰ
(two lands) were primitive, we should have in Ionio *guipp not
χώρᾶ. Hence the long vowel of χώρᾶ is simply imitated from
that of ἵππω.
