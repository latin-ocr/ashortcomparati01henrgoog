, (101) IV. Stoma wita suffia -εσ-; the augmented perfect
tense ealled the pluperfeet3 the oldest and simplest type is
ᾔδεα (Ι knew), ἐλελοίπεα (Ι had left), eta-If the latter form goes
back to *the-kafarna:*tlalamo-ip, we are tempted to oom-
pare it with the Latin pluperfeot fugeram=tlfoa9=esam3 but,
in the first place, this genealogy is not historioally proved, and,
· in the second place, the Latin vocalism does not agree with the
Greek, the Latin a being incompatible with the Greek termina·
tion. It is true that the same divergenoe is noticeable between
the two imperfecte, Gk. ἦα (dipundium) and Lat. eram,
whioh can soaroely be separated. On the whole, the question
must be left undeoided, for the Latin mode of formation may
be a new development.

(102) V. stema with suffia -θηε first aorists passive,
ε’-ηέ-θη etseq, ἐλύθη-ν &teledam-This aorist, whioh is much
commorer than the aorist in η, seems nevertheless to belong

, to a comparatively late date, though it had already spread

considerably in the time of Homer. There is no form certainly
corresponding to it in Latin, and its origin is obscure. It is
possible that the aorist in -η of a verb with the suffix -θω, ay.
ἐ-νύηθη from νηθω (to spin), may have been referred by mis-
take to the simple verb, aq. νέ-ω, and that then the relation of
νέω to ἐνήθη gave rise to a similar relation between λύω and
ἐλύθη. But this explanat-ion is only hypothetioal.¹

Vl. Stenas with suffiae -ησινι second futures passive—By
adding the future suffix -oo to the stem of the aorist in η,
Greek formed a future passive, φανη-σο-μαι, which stands to
ε’-φύ-νη-ν in tho same relation as the middle θή-σύμαι stands to
ἔ-θην.

VII. soemo with suffia -θησο-; first fut-ures passiva-The

1 A later and in many respeots more probabis hypothesis (Wackernagel¹
Κ. Ζ. xxx. p. 302) starts from tho sanskrit termination of the 2nd sing.
mid. thas, whioh it restores to the Indo-European language under the form
¹-tuas=(}k. -θης, In this system, ἐ-λύ-θης, ior example, would be merely
the 2nd pers. sing. middle of an aorist stem ‘l-ku- (supra 871), on the
analogy ot which would afterwards bs based the other forms ἐλύθην ἐλύθη,
imitated from those of the aorist in -η-. The author has reaently shown
(Ball. Soc. Liay. vii. p. 29) that t·7rrt-o-dnr=Sk. apitii-sabaa is probably
2nd pers. mid ot asigmatio aorist‚ and that thence we may explain the
sigmatio insertion in ηνω-σ-τό-ς, eto. ot. supro 64 note.
