Lat. scindo, Germ. echeideo, etc, it ie perfectly allowable to
infera common root *albich wrtb the primitive meaning of
“ cutting, dividing,'' but itis not allowable to conclude that in
the Indo-European language there wae ever a word *skbid
having a separate existence apart from the various formative
clemente with which we always find it associated. .

The reason ie very simple. It would be a grave mietake
to suppose that the formationes words ie based upon alogical
process of combination, due to reflection, or that it is based,
ae it were, upon the mathematical additiones two factore, the
root supplying the general meaning, and the euffix limiting
and particularizing thie meaning,1ae ie represented to be the
ease in theoretical analyses. This may possibly have been the
caee in a certain number of very primitive formatione, whieb
however constitute a stratum so ancient and so deeply buried
beneath the subsequent accretione of language, that it seems
almost impossible to reach it. But, ae soon as they were
produced, these first words eerved ae models for the creation
of others by meane of analogy; and, ae the speaker does not
analyse the language which he speaks, we must naturally
expect that, in thie scarcely eonscious process of analogy,
be will be eatiefied with a merely external and superficial
resemblance. Hence the numerous etymological deviatione,
the cause and influenoe of which will be beet illustrated by
a familiar example.

vWe have in French a suffix -a'er, the regular representative
of Latin onum, -dorium, which hasbeen added, among other
worde, to various worde ending in an etymologica] t: icit
luit-ier, sobet sobet-ier, clau elcut-ier, etc. But as the t hae
long ceaeed to be pronounced in tait, sobet, and hae even
ceaeed to be written in clou, the speaker does not now ieo-
late in thought, in the derivative words, the element -ier,
which be no longer perceivee in them, but the element -tier,
which he fancies he perceivee in them, and he transfere thie -
clement entire to other derivatives3 hence from the words
bijou, cose, fer-bione he forme the secondary words bijou·

¹ Eg. ’sthid (idea of eplitting) and *to (demonstrative, cf. Gk. τό), whence
*stlta-re, literally ‘⁸ split-it‚” Gk. exto-rte, “that which (ie) eplit.”
