equally noticeable. Asin the preceding class, the root ought

to be weakened‚ since the Sanskrit acoent falls sometimes on
the suffix, sometimes on the termination, never on the radical
syllable. But Greek shows only a very few forms with
weakened root, ‹love-pr (Ι ronse), τύ-νύ-μαι (Ι stretch)=*†p-n⁹›·
μαι, of. τείνω and τατύς; and most verbs of this class πήγ-νύμι,
ῥήγ-νῦ-μι, ρὥ-νῦ-μι, ζεύγ·νῦ-μι, dcix-virui, ete„ show the normal
grade. The vocalism of the sigmatio futures and aorists, in
which this grado is regular, πήξω, ῥήξω, δείξω, ζεύξω, must have
influenced the vocalism of the present.

There is a transition to the thematic conjugation in Greek
τα-νύω (Ι stretoh), and perhaps also in the form μι-νύω nei-nne
(Nessea), which is common to Greek and Latin.

As is indicated by the theory and shown by the examples‚ the
root, which was accented in the primitive language‚ always
assumes the normal form; we have already had occasion to
contrusi λείψω and ἔ·λιπ-ο-ν, ‹body-to and ἔφυγ-ο-ν, adr-opor and
ε’-πτ·ό-μην. In the very rare cases in whioh the root seems
to be weakened in the present, Gk. ἄρχ-ω, prix-opat, γρύφ-ω,

bablya second aorist stem has been substituted for a regular
present stem like *pax-epar, *ype‘ohn etc. Itis not even
necessary to suppose that this substitution is due to analogy 3¹
for, just as the imperfect is the present tense augmented, it is
very possible that the so-oalled second aorist is the augmented
tense of another present, almost lost. In other words, the
known series Z-deoyov only-o requires a corresponding theo-
retical series ἔ-φυγ-ο-ικ ’φύγω but the second term of the latter

spread very little and ended by falling into disuse, whereas the . ·

other series remained unohanged.2

We must even go further. Given a root *blica it could no doubt be

conjugated, at the option of the speaker, with no offix 'tter-nt (of. Lat.
