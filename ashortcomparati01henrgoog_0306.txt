(244) The secondary endings in Greek are added to the follow·
ing verbal forms: (1) non-thematic aorist,¹ ἔ-θη-ν, ἔ-χε(Ὲ)-α (Ι
poured); (2) thematic aorist, ἔ-φυγο-ν; (3) non-thematic im-
perfect, ἐ-τίθη-ν, &iclxvi-m (4) thematic imperfect, ἔ-λυο-ν; (5)

(7) ορωῇνθεό( all tenseS, δοίη-ν, λύσει-α; (8) aorists passive,
{misy-11, ε’-λύθη-ν. In Latin the secondary and primary series
have been confused,2 and the resulting series is used sor all ⁴
tenses of the verb, except the perfect indicative and the im-
perative.

(245) I. diasyrtica—1. The secondary ending of the lst

person is i-oz astera vowel, and consequently *oy after a
consonant: in Greek, -ν and -α respectively;³ in Latin, always
aa, because the termination is added only to vocalio stems,
except possibly in eram, which may be corrupted for *er-em
:ies-ry, cf. Gk. ἧοι.4 The termination alter a vowel is every-

where very plain : Gk. ἔ-δω-ν, ε’-δίδω-ν, &hepo-v, ε’-λέχθνγν, λεχθείη-ν,
ete, Lat. leyaoa, leyche-m, lepore-m, siren (ι’-1η, veli-at,
siderion, ete. In Greek however the optatives of thematie .

tenses, which, like the others, have the secondary endings .

throughout the rest of their inflexion, have adopted the
primary ending -μι in the lst pers. sing: lnior-pv,b λύσοι-μι,
and so also λύσαι-μι, hebriaca-pt. The regular rpe'plov-t‘ is found
