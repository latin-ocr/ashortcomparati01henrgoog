cencessum vocamen. 33

Latin perfect fot-t, which may go back equally well either to
*fatui or *fou-vi (supra 26, 2 and infru 34 B β).

(32) 5. 1.-ns=(tk. e=Lat ἔ. This exact agreement, which
is almost absolutely regular,1 is, as we have seen, the essential
oriterion of classification for the IndoEuropean languages.

We shall examine successively simple ἔ ande forming partos ’

adiphthong.

A.-Simple a: I.-E. *es-ti (he is), Gk. ἐσ-τι, Lat. es-t3 I.-E.
*edo (Ι eat), Gk. the, Lat. edm I.·E. *qe (and), Gk. τε, Lat.
que3 I.-E. *genos (birth), gen. *genes-os, Gk. γέν-ος γένεοςε
⁴⁸ γέν-εσ-ος, Lat. genas gea-eris: *peaes-affl final e in voca-
tive of End decl, Gk. ἴππ-ε, Lat. equam final e of 2nd person
singular present imperative, Gk. ἅγ-ε, Lat. ay-e3 final -tc of
2nd person plural imperative, Gk. ἅγ-ε-τε, Lat. (ιμ’-ια ἒ in
reduplication of perfect, λέ-λοιπ-α, οε-οἱά-ῑ, ’

ε in Greek always remains unchanged. But in Latin

(a) The group cv regularly becomes dv by labialization of

the vowel under the influence of the labial: Gk. νέοςενέὶος, ’

Lat. *ucoca whence novos; Gk. raldo, {fcio (= *σὸόή (thina,
his), Lat. tovos, savos (archaia), later tuus, suus3 Gk. ἐν-νέαε
*ev-vta (I.-E. *new-p), Lat. nov-em, etc.

· (β) Unaooented ἕ, when not final, is changed to t : thus we
have aye=dye, but aqile=dytre, αρὶθηίηῑεᾶγόμενοι or ἄγέμεναι,
and agis (thou dost) = *agea which is perhaps equivalent to
the Dorio form ἆγες (common Greek ἄγεις) and certainly to an
I.-E. form *dy-es (cf. Sk. ὂὴάναε-τφέρες).

’ To this change of unaocented ἔ is due the well-known weaken-
ing of the vowel in compounds: layo cdlliyo, *specio (cf. Gk. σκέπ.
ropac) inspicio. According to the law laid down we should ex-
pect colligo, but *collegam *inspecera iuspecto, since in these
words e remains accented. κ But it must be observed, on the one
hand, that the phenomenon may, and indeed must, have taken

¹There is scarcely any important exception that cannot be explained,
besides taros=equos3 but the ι is not the only irregularity in ἵππος, and the
rough breathing, which has nothing corresponding to it elsewhere (sk. acam),
and which is not reproduced in compounde (Λεύκιππος not ’Λεύχιππος),
pbints to a series oi accidental alterationem this word, which still remain
obscure.
