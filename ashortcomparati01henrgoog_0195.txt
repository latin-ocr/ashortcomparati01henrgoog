formed the feminine of these adjectives (in Sk. suad-cie (sweet),
fem. ecdici), just as the fem. acris contrasted with the masc.
acer is perhaps a reminiscence of some prehistoric feminine
*akr-t, so that these derivatives would belong to the preceding
class. ’

(153) III. Saffioc -wo·.-This suffix seems to have developed
in Latin the secondary' derivativas in -ivo-, which are rather
common as adjectivae: nocivo-e, captivos, fugitivo-s, and
others. ἦ

(154) IV. Sufflcc -0n·.—Secondary in Greek in noodr
(panther, gen. -ῶν-ος) derived 'from κοιν-ό·ς (common), in αἰ-ών
(age, gen. αἰ-ὣν-ος 1) derived from a lost form *ai-fir identical
with Lat. ‹rc-voca. It is especially common in Latin, where,
under the same form o -oa-is, it is added to the primary or
secondarysuffix ὥτ’-2 to form feminine nouns of action, cic-tio,
auc-tio, oratii-c, audi-tio, auceia, by a regular and well known
praeese. It is also found added, either to stems in -io, in which
case it is contracted with the thematic vowel 0, leq-io, cf.
colloq-im, choici-io, cf. occid-ium, or to consonante] nieme,
especially adjectivae in oc, in which it changes the final gut

of feminine nouus in ape, seringe, image, and subsidiarily
in -tyo and -upo, or-iyc, rubigo, ferr-apo, ictu-apo, etc. It was
doubtless an exactly similar phonetic process which changed
the secondary suffix tati· to -todfo (iufra 174), aq. the doublets
servitiis and sarcitudo (through thc genitive servitudinis:
*servi-tutonis), and we know how often this clement -ti‘cdo in
Latin forms feminine abstract noune, soli-tude, vale-tetdo, cco-
suc-iodo, etc.

(155) V. Suffioc -rno-.-Rarely secondary in Latin ; very
common in Greek, where it forms nouns of action (oxytone) cor-
