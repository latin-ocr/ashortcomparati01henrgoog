(to sleep), aiod-dronae (to perceive); this mode of formation
’ was much extended by analogy.

4. In [satin the earne class of forms followed a very different
phonetic read. Eg. the root pac (to make firm, cf. Gk. πήγ-νυ-μι
end Lat. pac-s, treaty), by the addition of the euffix -oto- to
the weakened form, will give successively *pac-oo, *paq-tto
and *party-ne, after which, the group hya becoming reduced to
dyst there remaina the known form paupe. In the same way
we may explain tango, stringo, pande, lumbo, as compared
with tec-tue, stricta-s, pat-eo, labio-m (lip), namely, through
*patho (cf. Gk. uir-oppt), *lab-ae, etc.; and it will be noticed
that in certain verbe (jungo juant junctura, cf. jug-uon,
(uitantque *uiae-tus, etc, cf. Gk. στίζωε*στίγ-ῃω), the
nasalizaticn is not confined to the present, but is extended by
analogy to the whole conjugation.

(94) This last observation leads us to another ofa more
general character. All the different present-signs, reduplica-
tionS, and affixos mentioned above, of⁴ which the euffix -ao· is
the last, do not by their nature belong to the verb itself, but,
as a general rule, effect only the present cf the verb: and so
they disappear regularly in the other tenses, cf. δι’·δω-μι idon,

δάμ-νη-μι bapti-oe, δείκ·νῦ-μι δείκ-σω, σχίζωε*σχίδ-ῃω and σχίσω ·

dextere, λαμβ-άνω ἔ-λαβ-ινν, etc, etc, and in Latin nosco
oevi, cer-uo cre-vt, capio cept, tany-o te-tiy-i, etet But it
-wes likewiee inevitable that the form of the present should
occasionally influence that of the other tenses, and that so an
affix belonging exclusively to the present should in course oi
time spread to part or even *the whole of the rest of the con·
jugation. Hence, by the side of the regular δώσω we find the
Homeric διδώσω,3 and even more naturally tho reduplicated

· ¹ Itis not possible however to reduoethis change to acertuinand inva-
riable lev, cf, cupra 625. ’

² Hence, strictly speaking, it is incorrect to say that δείξω, for example,
is the future of δείκνῦμι. The present, future. and perfect form distinct
systema, periectlyindependent of one another. 'l'he truth is, that δείξω is
the future of the root δεικ (to show), ol which δείκνῡμι is the present,
δέδειχα the perfect, etc, etc.
