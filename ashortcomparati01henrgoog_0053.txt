no exceptions3 for, when once a law hasbeen discovered,
to admit by the side of it or beneath it isoleted facts supposed
to have escaped its action would beto fall again, in spite of
oneeelf, into the well-worn rut of arbitrary etymologias.l

¹ Hence we must avoid such phrases as “ In Latin e between tvo vovels ’

osteo becomes νβ’ Aphonetic law either existe or does not exist; there
is no other alternative. If Latin e between vowels becomes r, it does so
always. Ii it sometimee'seeme to have remained anchanged, we must seek
the reason of this apparent retention. This kind ot investigation bas already
been carried very lar, and we shall see many instancee of it. [ct. p. 76, note]
