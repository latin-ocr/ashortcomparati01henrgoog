δέρη (throat) the η was not preceded by p, but by a f, which was
lost after the change of the ᾶ, so that the primitive forms would
be *xdpfot (cf. Lesb. κόρρᾶ, Dor. κώρᾶ, Ion. κούρη) and *δέρῖιί (cf.
Sk. grivo, throat, and Lesb. δέρρᾶ); on the other hand, στοᾱ
(perch) goes back to στοιᾶ, which is also found, and Ἀθηνᾶ <the
goddess) is not the same word as Ἀθήνη, but, as the acuent
shows, a contractiori from ἈθηνάᾶεἈθηναίᾰ. The numerous
nouns of the first declension like δόξᾶ, potori, ἅμιλλᾶ, etc, have
a short a, and go back to quites different origin.1

This being the case, we should expect never to find any
instances of ᾶ in Ionic or Attio, except ᾶ pure. Some instances
however do occur ; but in these the ᾶ was not original, but was
developed in Ionio alone aster the separation of dialects‚ and
consequently long after the change of Panhellenic ᾶ to Ionic η,
Thus the accus. plur. τᾶς μούσᾰς goes back to an old Greek form
τᾶνς μούσᾶνς, of which instances are still found in inscriptions
(Cretan). Similarly in πᾶσαι-πᾶνσα, λῦσᾰσαελῦσᾶνσα, (δῖα,
the corresponding Lesbian forms ταὶς μοίσαις, παῖσα, lucaico,
etc, show that the Ionic long vowel was not original.

α in diphthongs is not uncommon, especially in the combina-
tion oy, but presents no important peculiarity.

g 2. Serui-vowels.

(38) Greekhas no special symbol for the semi-vowel p, which
is written i, whether it occurs between two vowels or in a
diphthong. The semi-vowel w is denoted by υ when occurring
in a diphthong‚ but when used asan independent semi-vowel,
is represented by the sign t, the sixth letter of the alphabet
in the AEolic and Doric dialects. It was in fact only these dia·
lects‚ and especially Dorio,2 which preserved faithfully the pro-
nunciation of the f, which was doubtless very like that of the
English w, and was lost at a very early period in the Ionic-
Attia dialect.

Latin has no special symbol for y and w 3 the Romans wrote
inquot, nouos, just as if these words had been trisyllables.

1 hasra 112 and 197.

2 It will be seen that the ordinary name ot ‘⁸ AEolic digamma ’' is not
strictly accurate. The fi no longer appears in the Lesbian poets.
